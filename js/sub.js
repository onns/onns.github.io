94
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,610
-你说什么都改变不了...-我羊水破了

-是吗  -对
- Yep? - Yeah.

96
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,810
我觉得我的人生偏离轨道
You know when I think it all went wrong for me

97
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,990
是在1986年  小学二年级
was 1986, second grade.

98
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:39,430
当时挑战者号正要发射到太空
They were sending the Challenger up into space.

99
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,350
你们记得挑战者号吧
You remember the Challenger, right?

100
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:42,210
-桑德拉·布洛克演的呗  -不是
- Yeah. With Sandra Bullock? - No.

101
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:42,210
{\an8}演员  出演《地心引力》

102
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,690
{\an8}社会学教师  因挑战者号失事而牺牲

103
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,830
是克里斯塔·麦考利夫Christa McAuliffe, right?

104
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,690
她本来会成为第一位进入外太空的教师
She was gonna be the first teacher into space.

105
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:47,520
她本来将会改变世界的
She was actually gonna change the world.

106
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,860
虽然不知道如何改变  但我就是相信
I don't know how, but you could feel that, you know?

107
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,220
至少在二年级的时候  我很相信
At least, in second grade, you could... you could feel it.

108
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,170
那天上学
Middle of the school day,

109
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:54,860
老师抬进来一台电视
the teacher brings in a TV, right?

110
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,260
我们都坐着  看发射现场
We're all just sitting there, watching the launch,

111
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:59,410
一群七八岁的孩子坐在一起看
a bunch of seven-year-olds just-just watchin'.

112
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,040
突然一声巨响
And all of a sudden, boom!

113
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,890
飞船直接爆炸了
The whole thing explodes.

114
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,350
克里斯塔·麦考利夫的碎片
Little pieces of sweet Christa McAuliffe

115
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,730
洒遍了佛罗里达州的土地
come raining down all over the state of Florida.

116
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,080
太惨烈了
It was awful.

117
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,880
也许就是那时  我意识到了
Maybe that's when I realized trying to change the world

118
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:15,320
改变世界就意味着
just leads to being blown up

119
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,290
被炸成碎片四处飘散
into little pieces all over Florida.

120
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,800
所以我才成了《靓男保姆》的演员
Maybe that's how I wound up as the Man-ny.

121
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,840
我妹电话
It's my sister.

122
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,480

Kate?

123
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:40,700
你...你没有冰块了  所以...
You... you didn't have any ice, so...

124
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,350
这可真是人生低谷了
Well, this is a low point.

125
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,270
我们36了
We're 36.

126

正式进入三十的后半段
We're officially late 30s.

127
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:56,230
马上就要奔四了
Like, we are deep in the threes.

128
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:58,960
没错
Yep.

129
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,980
我怎么会到这种地步
How did I get here?

130
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:06,070
我怎么会变成这幅样子
Like, how the hell did I get here?

131
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:07,700
还记得二年级  挑战者号爆炸吗
Remember second grade, the Challenger explosion?

132
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,270
别再提挑战者号爆炸这事了
You have got to stop with the Challenger explosion.

133
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,320
肯定有关系
There's something there.

134
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:16,480
你是我这辈子唯一美好的事情  小凯
You're the only good thing in my life, Kev.

135
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,030
我可没那么好  得了吧
I'm not that great. Come on.

136
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:19,620
我知道
I know.

137
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:21,190
所以我才更惨
That's what makes it worse.

138
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,160
我憧憬着
I had this...

139
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,930
自己梦想中的生活
whole dream life that I envisioned for myself.

140
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,300

A real career... ?

141
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,530
嫁一个老爸那样的男人
I would marry a man like Dad.

142
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:38,020
做个妈妈那样的老妈
I would be a mom like Mom.

143
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,760
可你看看我  小凯
But look at me, Kev.

144
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:45,290
我把自己的梦想吃了个精光
Like, I ate my dream life away.

145
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,250
你想让我怎么安慰你
So what do you... what do you want me to say to you, huh?

146
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,120
好妹妹  只要能让你好受点
Wh-What... Give me the magic phrase, sis,

147
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,960
你想听什么  我都跟你说
to say to make you feel better and I'll say it.

148
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,200
让我别再自怨自艾之类的
Tell me to quit feeling sorry for myself. I don't know.

149
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,070
让我振作起来  让我...
Tell me to wake the hell up. Tell me,

150
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:01,310
让我减掉这身该死的肥肉
tell me to lose the damn weight.

151
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,240
别再自怨自艾
Quit feeling sorry for yourself.

152
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:06,270
明白吗  马上就可以开始  振作起来
All right? That can start right now. Wake the hell up.

153
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,440
还有  还有...
And-and, you know...

154
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,360
第三...  第三是什么事来着
the... What was the... what was the third thing?

155
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,830
减掉这身该死的肥肉
Lose the damn weight.

156
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,310
要再说一遍吗
You want to say that again?

157
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,900
我要减掉这身该死的肥肉
I'm gonna lose the damn weight.

158
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:31,520
你比看起来要聪明多了
You are a lot smarter than you look.

159
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,000
迈克尔·贝[著名导演]也这么说我
That's what Michael Bay told me.

160
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,830
放松点
Here you go.

161
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,570
好  谢谢
Oh, yeah. Thank you.

162
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,470
你有没有意识到
Hey, do you realize me and the kids

163
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:49,250
我跟孩子们会是同一天生日
are gonna have the same birthday?

164
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:50,770
-对啊  -是啊
- I know. - Yeah.

165
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,430
不过提前六周也早太多了
Still, six weeks early is pretty early.

166
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:55,990
是啊  我知道
Yeah. I know.

167
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:08,910
这东西能干什么用啊
What the hell could this thing possibly be for?

168
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,560
是做肛检的
It's for rectal examinations.

169
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,360
那个已经用过了
That one's from the dirty pile.

170
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,240
抱歉
Sorry.

171
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,680
我是卡托斯基医生
Now, then, I'm Dr. Katowski,

172
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:22,530
你们可以叫我医生或者卡医生
but you can call me Doc or Dr. K,

173
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:25,040
人们一般都这么叫我
which is what most people choose to do

174
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:26,660
因为这样更亲切
because it's folksy.

175
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,620
这么说你是施耐德医生的同事
So you work with Dr. Schneider?

176
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:30,410
来做个深呼吸  亲爱的
Take a breath for me, dear.

177
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:32,950
深呼吸
Deep breath, now.

178
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,480
很好
There you go.

179
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,400
好了  放松点没  很好  很好
All right. You relaxed? Good, good, good.

180
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:41,730
一小时前施耐德医生阑尾破裂
Dr. Schneider's appendix burst an hour ago.

181
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,410
他刚刚去做手术了
He just went into surgery.

182
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:44,160
别怕  别怕  听我说
No, no, no, no, no. Now, stay with me.

183
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,840
老天啊  不行  我需要施耐德医生
Oh, God. No, I need Dr. Schneider.

184
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,890
-因为他了解我的...  -听我说
- 'Cause he knows about... - Stay with me now.

185
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:49,140
虽然疼得直叫唤
Between his screams of agony,

186
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:53,150
施耐德还是让我掌握了你的所有情况
Schneider brought me up to speed on everything concerning your case.

187
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,910
我知道你怀的是三胞胎
I know all about these triplets,

188
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,710
-我知道你是高危妊娠  -是的
- and I know that this is a high-risk pregnancy. - Yeah.

189
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:00,050
但你一定会平安无事的
But everything's gonna be all right.

190
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:01,700
你是在跟我们开玩笑吗
This is some kind of bad joke, right?

191
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,730
不好意思  我没开玩笑
It is not, unfortunately.

192
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:07,370
亲爱的  现在我要你注意听我说
Now, sweetheart, I'm gonna get straight to your first concern.

193
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:09,070
看着我  看着我
Look at me now. Look at me.

194
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:13,350
看到我了吗  我今年73了
Do you see me? I am 73 years old.

195
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,220
-知道这意味着什么吗  -不知道
- You know what that means, don't you? - No.

196
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,250
这意味着我不能像以前一样跑得那么快
That means I don't run wind sprints as fast as I used to,

197
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:23,320
但我的身体机能依然十分良好
but my faculties are otherwise completely intact.

198
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,090
有时我倒是希望不那么好
There are days that I wish they weren't,

199
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:29,040
那样我就能退休去安度晚年
because then I would retire and spend my remaining days

200
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:30,680
做点更有意思的事
doing something more glamorous

201
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,660
而不是把七八斤重的孩子从产道里拽出来
than pulling eight-pound objects out of women's vaginas.

202
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,200
不过在那之前
But until that time,

203
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,430
我每天都会来医院
I keep showing up here every day.

204
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:38,720
明白了吗
All right?

205
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,870
我也知道  对你来说我完全是个陌生人
I'm also aware that I'm a complete stranger to you,

206
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:46,570
而今天是你人生中最重要的日子
and this is the biggest moment of your life.

207
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:47,470
是的
Yeah.

208
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:50,700
好了  亲爱的  听我说
All right? Honey, listen to me.

209
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,110
我是最好的医生
I am the best of the best.

210
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:58,380
我以我儿孙的性命向你保证
And I swear to you, on the lives of my children and my grandchildren,

211
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,990
我能胜任这场手术
that I am up to the task.

212
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:02,350
-好吗  -好的
- All right? - Okay.

213
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:03,760
-那好  -谢谢你
- All right. - Thank you.

214
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,620
很好
All right. Good.

215
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:09,330
那么  你们俩谁是孕妇
Now, which one of you's pregnant?

216
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:12,530
这就是逗你玩了
Now, that was a bad joke,

217
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:15,640
不过你还要继续做深呼吸
but you just continue to take those deep breaths...

218
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,660
让我看看  看看这儿有没有我的同族人
Let's see... let me see if any of my people are here.

219
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:20,560
我来做个小测试  不许说话[希伯来语]Let me take a little test. Sheket bevakasha!

220
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,580
你是犹太人  你也是
Jew! Jew!

221
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,230
还有你
Jew!

222
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,090
好了  注意了
All right, hey! Come on!

223
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,860
准备...开拍
And... action!

224
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:34,440
{\an8}《靓男保姆》

225
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,330
我怎么才能让你开心点
What can I do to make you feel better, huh?

226
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,990
想让我喂你奶吗
You want me to breastfeed you?

227
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:40,010
我喂你喝奶  你会开心点吗
Would that make you feel better, if I breastfed ya?

228
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:42,510
是吗  来吧  咱们试试...
Yeah? Here we go. Let's try to...

229
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:53,140
很抱歉  伙计们  我得暂停一下
I'm-I'm sorry, guys. I need to cut. Uh...

230
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,390
抱歉  各位  出了点技术故障
Sorry, everybody. A little technical difficulty.

231
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,600
谁想要纪念衫
Who wants a T-shirt? ?

232
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,400
-伙计  -怎么了
- Hey, man. - What's up?

233
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,610
很抱歉  我在试着理解我的角色
I'm sorry. You know, I'm trying to understand, for my character,

234
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:05,870
我们是在暗示
you know, um, are-are we suggesting, you know,

235
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:09,110
主人公真以为一个成年男人能给孩子喂奶吗
that the Man-ny thinks a grown man can breastfeed a baby?

236
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:10,360
难倒主人公是脑残吗
Are we saying the Man-ny's got brain damage?

237
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,710
我可以把嗓音装得像点
'Cause I could do a voice.

238
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,090
凯文  我知道你在乎
Kevin, I know you care.

239
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,050
我知道你在乎这个角色
I know you care about the character.

240
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:15,670
我确实在乎这个角色  谢谢
I do care about the character. Thank you.

241
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,920
我还知道你已经三十多岁
I also know that you're a 30-something-year-old actor

242
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,290
可你演过的最重要的角色
whose biggest previous role

243
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:20,650
只是《音乐之乡》里出现三集的龙套
was a three-episode arc on Nashville.

244
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:23,550
好好念台词  不然就另谋高就吧
So say the line or find another job.

245
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:26,030
相信我  在你回到你的车上之前
Because trust me when I say that I'll have you replaced

246
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:28,030
我就能找到瑞安·高斯林  瑞安·菲利普
by Ryan Gosling, Ryan Phillippe, or Ryan Reynolds

247
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:28,780
瑞安·雷诺兹[皆为著名演员]or any other handsome Ryan

248
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,910
或者别的叫瑞安的帅哥顶替你
by the time you get to your car.

249
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,530
相信我  收视率会上去的
And believe me, my ratings will go up.

250
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:37,760
瑞安·高斯林才不会拍这种垃圾
Ryan Gosling would never do this crap.

251
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,870
你说得对  凯文
You are right, Kevin.

252
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:41,890
瑞安·高斯林绝不会拍这种垃圾
Ryan Gosling would never do this crap.

253
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:43,540
记住了
Remember that.

254
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:50,020
加油  安妮
Come on, Annie!

255
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,050
去抢球  亲爱的
Go get the ball, hon!

256
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,440
爸爸
Hi, Daddy!

257
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,900
宝贝  球在那儿呢
Hi, sweetheart! There's the ball!

258
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,940
你不去踢球吗
You want to play soccer?

259
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:00,710
-球...  -她怎么样
- It... ? - How's she doing?

260
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:03,640
我觉得她在为下半场保存体力
Uh, I think she's saving it for the second half.

261
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,240
她呢
How's about her?

262
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:10,290
-弄哭四个男孩了  -这才是我家小霸王
- Four boys crying and counting. - That's my little bad ass.

263
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:12,120
-换吗  -换
- Switch? - Switch.

264
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:17,610
-那是...  -法式辫  没错
- Is that a... - French braid. Yes.

265
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:20,130
两股头发交织一下  宝贝
Over, under, back through, baby!

266
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:23,300
-妈妈  -好吧  她交到个朋友
- Hi, Mommy! - All right, well, she made a friend.

267
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,740
我找到他了
I found him.

268
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:28,410
我父亲
My father.

269
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,420
什么  什么时候
What? When?

270
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,190
我雇了个人
I, uh... I hired a guy.

271
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,460
花了大概一千五百块
It cost about 1,500 bucks.

272
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:37,900
我拿信用卡付的  你会看到的
Now, I paid for it on the Amex. You're gonna see it.

273
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,220
是我自己那张卡  不是办公用的
It's the personal Amex, not the business Amex.

274
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,860
-我知道  我不在乎是哪张卡  -我知道
- I know, I don't care about the Amex. - I know.

275
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,010
-那你打算...  -不
- So you're gonna... - No.

276
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:44,900
为什么
Why not?

277
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,080
因为她是个瘾君子  在分娩时就去世了
Because she was a crack addict who died during childbirth,

278
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,180
而那个男人把我丢在消防局门口
and he was the guy who left me at a fire station,

279
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,990
可能仅仅因为他想不到更老套的办法
probably because he couldn't think of anything more cliche.

280
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,570
那你为什么还去找他
So why'd you find him?

281
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,600
我不知道  贝丝
I don't know, Beth.

282
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,510
我真不知道
I really don't know.

283
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:06,900
好球
Oh! Go!

284
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,570
太棒了  苔丝
Way to go, Tess!

285
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:10,220
友谊第一  宝贝
Sportsmanship, baby!

286
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,500
不好意思
Excuse me.

287
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,820
能给我吗
Do you mind?

288
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,280
然后我对自己说  "塔尼亚
And so, I said to myself, "Tanya,

289
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:47,060
你已经完成了最初的目标
You have done what you have set out to do.

290
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,500
你减掉了体重
You have lost the weight.

291
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:53,090
现在你可以帮别人变得和你一样苗条"
And now you can help others be skinny like you."

292
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,070
谁想先来分享一下
So, who would like to share first?

293
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:01,160
我每次开始节食
Every time I'm going on a diet,

294
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,150
他就给我捣乱
he sabotages me.

295
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:05,610
那天半夜  我老公发现
Well, my husband found me eating out of the fridge

296
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:08,280
我又在冰箱里翻吃的
in the middle of the night again the other night.

297
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:11,720
我在努力
I'm trying.

298
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,680
我没给你捣乱  玛莎
I'm not sabotaging you, Marsha.

299
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,590
我知道自己身上没有你们的问题
I know I don't have the same issues as everyone here.

300
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:20,950
但你们体会不到  像我这么苗条的人
But you guys don't know what it's like looking like me

301
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:23,740
怀着六七斤的孩子是什么感觉
and carrying around that extra seven pounds in your midsection.

302
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:31,910
要我说
For me,

303
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,480
就得怪我妈
it was my mom.

304
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:35,150
她从不让我们吃披萨
She never let us eat pizza.

305
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:39,240
所以我现在一看见披萨
And so now, every time I see a pizza,

306
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,050
就忍不住要把整块披萨都吃光
I mean, I have to eat the entire thing.

307
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:43,690
如果互助会也没用
If this doesn't work,

308
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,370
我只能用订书机把胃订上  接受现实了
I might just have my stomach stapled and just be done with...

309
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,940
不好意思
I am sor... I'm sorry.

310
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,150
我只是在脑补订书机
I was just-- I was picturing the stapler.

311
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:01,200
实在是太失礼了
And it's-- which is totally inappropriate.

312
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,430
我道歉
I apologize.

313
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,260
我比你胖多了  如果这么说...
I'm way fatter than you if it...

314
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,690
能让你好受些
means anything.

315
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,960
咖啡
Mmm, coffee.

316
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:19,830
你好
Hi.

317
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:25,230
这些人讨厌我
Boy, these people hate me.

318
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:27,080
你有点越界了
You kind of crossed the line.

319
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,400
不过你笑了
Yeah, you laughed.

320
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:32,020
因为越界对我来说是家常便饭
That's because I live across the line.

321
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,160
好吧
Okay.

322
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:35,400
托比
Toby.

323
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:36,750
凯特
Kate.

324
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,660
很高兴见到你
Nice to meet you.

325
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:41,650
你想成为胖友吗
So, you want to be fat friends?

326
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:44,790
当然
Sure.

327
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:47,700
不过我正打算减肥
But I'm gonna lose the weight.

328
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,200
我不这么打算
I'm probably not.

329
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:52,100
好吧
Okay.

330
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,740
我现在可不能和一个胖子谈恋爱
I can't fall for a fat person right now.

331
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,270
好吧
Well...

332
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,120
那看来我得减肥了
I guess I'll lose the weight then.

333
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:12,580
呼吸  小贝  呼吸  呼吸  呼吸
Breathe, Bec. Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe.

334
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,700
呼吸  呼吸
Breathe. Breathe.

335
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:15,820
深呼吸  小贝
Deep breath, Bec.

336
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,260
深呼吸  深呼吸
Deep breath, deep breath.

337
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,720
深呼吸  看着我  深呼吸
Deep breathe, look at me, deep breathe.

338
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,600
加油
There you go.

339
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,790
加油  就快成功了  差不多了
There you go, almost done, almost done.

340
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,540
加油   加油
There you go. Hey, there you go.

341
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:31,100
宝贝  我接下来两小时说的话别放心上
Baby, I'm sorry for anything I'm gonna say in the next two hours.

342
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,280
我全都不是故意的
I mean none of it.

343
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,010
肯定有一部分是故意的
You're gonna mean some of it.

344
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:35,410
-就一点点  -有道理
- Very little of it. - Fair enough.

345
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:37,610
我有点庆幸施奈德得了阑尾炎了
I'm almost glad Schneider's appendix burst.

346
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:38,980
我喜欢你们两个
I like you two.

347
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:40,660
既然我是你的新医生
Now since I'm new here,

348
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:43,020
也许我们该在事态恶化之前
I thought we might have a conversation now

349
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,380
先聊聊
before things get more intense.

350
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,330
好主意
Yeah, that sounds nice.

351
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,650
你说你都有孙子辈了
So, you said you have grandchildren?

352
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,420
不是聊这个
Not that kind of conversation.

353
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,650
我知道施奈德医生跟你们说过
Now. I know that Dr. Schneider talked to you about

354
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,130
胎位的事情
the positioning of the babies,

355
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:56,310
以及这次分娩的复杂情况
and how complicated this delivery could get.

356
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:57,280
-我认为我们应该...  -不好意思
- I thought we should... - I'm sorry,

357
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,230
不  我们不想聊这个
no, we're not gonna have this conversation.

358
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:00,530
杰克  我们得谈...
Jack, we need to have this...

359
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:02,340
我们不谈这些  因为那不会发生
We're not having this conversation, because it's not gonna happen.

360
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,420
我们得讨论一下...
Well, we need to talk about...

361
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,280
我们会带着三个健康的宝宝
We are walking out of this hospital with

362
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,050
和健康的妻子一起走出医院
three healthy babies and one healthy wife.

363
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:08,410
当然  但我们还是得... 
Absolutely, but we still...

364
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:10,180
我在新家准备了三张婴儿床
I have three cribs at our new home

365
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,900
新家是我们特别买的
that we bought specifically

366
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,570
-为了让三个孩子在里面长大  -我明白
- for our three children to grow up in. - I understand.

367
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:15,750
我母亲  我母亲
My-my mother, my mother

368
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,900
-还织了三件连体衣  -我知道
- has already knitted three onesies. - I know.

369
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,760
而她在编织方面不是很在行
And she's a slow, no-talent knitter.

370
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:22,860
而且今天恰巧是我的生日
It's also happens to be my birthday today,

371
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:24,520
今天注定是
which tends to be

372
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,470
我们家的大日子  是我的头号幸运日
a pretty great day in our house, a day when I get pretty lucky.

373
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:31,090
所以我请在座的各位相信我
So I'm gonna need everyone in this room to believe me

374
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:33,750
今天这里只会有好事发生
when I say that only good things are gonna happen here today.

375
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,150
事实上
Actually...

376
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,040
我不仅希望你们相信
I-I don't just want you to believe it,

377
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,010
我还希望你们清楚知道
I want you to know it.

378
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,370
你清楚吗  宝贝
Do you know it, baby?

379
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:47,160
我爱你
I love you.

380
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,570
我清楚  我清楚
Yeah, I know it. I know it.

381
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,440
你清楚吗  医生
Do you know it, Doc?

382
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,020
我知道我喜欢你
I know I like you.

383
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:04,180
我们这就开始  让你心想事成
Let's just start there, get you what you want.

384
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:08,500
好
Okay.

385
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,810
把我下午的安排取消
Hey, clear my afternoon?

386
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:16,380
-可是先生  那...  -谢谢
- But sir, what about... - Thanks.

387
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,130
来了  来了
Yeah, yeah.

388
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:37,240
别敲了
Stop all that banging,

389
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,950
你刚敲门  我就听见了
I heard you the first time, banging on the door.

390
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:40,840
到底是谁...
Who the hell is...

391
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,210
我叫兰德尔·皮辛  我是你亲生儿子
My name is Randall Peasing. I'm your biological son.

392
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:46,470
36年前你把我遗弃在消...
36 years ago you left me at the front door...

393
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:48,010
不  等一下  让我把话说完
No, hold on, just let me say this.

394
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:52,870
36年前你把我遗弃在消防局前门
36 years ago you left me at the front door of a fire station.

395
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:55,160
别担心  我不是来问你要什么的
Now, don't worry, I'm not here because I want anything from you.

396
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,670
我伟大的养父母把我抚养得很好
I was raised by two incredible parents,

397
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:00,280
我有自己的幸福家庭  而且...
I have a lights out family of my own, and...

398
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:02,560
看见停在你家门前的车了吗
that car you see parked out in front of your house?

399
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:06,550
是我现付14.3万买的
Cost $143,000 and I bought it for cash.

400
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,750
我付现金就因为我高兴
I bought it for cash because I felt like it,

401
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,630
因为我有钱任性
and because I can do stuff like that.

402
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,120
看到吗  我这么出人头地
Yeah, you see, I turned out pretty all right.

403
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:16,980
可能让很多人出乎意料
Which might surprise a lot of folks

404
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,030
毕竟36年前
considering the fact that 36 years ago

405
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:22,340
我只是那个躺在破篮子里
my life started with you leaving me on a fire station doorstep

406
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,120
裹着沾满屎的尿片
with nothing more than a ratty blanket

407
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,930
被你遗弃在消防局门阶上的孩子
and a crap-filled diaper.

408
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:31,030
我今天到这来就是想当面
I came here today so I could look you in the eye,

409
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:34,410
把这些话告诉你  然后回到我的豪车里
say that to you, and then get back in my fancy-ass car

410
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:37,540
最终向我自己证明  也向你证明
and finally prove to myself, and to you,

411
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,910
更向爱我的家人证明
and to my family who loves me,

412
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:41,330
我压根不需要从你那得到什么
that I didn't need a thing from you,

413
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:43,460
哪怕我知道了你的身份
even after I knew who you were.

414
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,610
你要进来吗
You want to come in?

415
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,650
好
Okay.

416
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:00,370
你有什么话想对我说吗
So is there something you want to say to me?

417
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,780
没有的话  我赶时间
'Cause otherwise, I really need to get going.

418
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,290
你想让我说什么吗
You want me to say something?

419
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:06,110
不  我说了  我不想从你那得到什么
No, I told you, I don't want anything from you.

420
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,940
-但你来了  -只是想告诉你那些话
- But you're here. - Just to tell you that.

421
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:09,540
好吧
Well...

422
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,030
我都听到了
I've been told.

423
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,340
如果你只是想坐在这儿找借口
You know what? If you're just gonna sit here making excuses...

424
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,700
-我没找借口  -因为你找不到
- Didn't make any excuses. - Because there's nothing you can say.

425
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,980
所以我并没有找借口
Didn't say anything for just that reason.

426
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,570
我觉得你是想让我忏悔  然后对我说
Seems to me you want me to try to make amends so you can say,

427
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:31,180
-"去你妈的"  然后甩门而去  -荒谬
- "Screw you," and storm out of here. - That's ridiculous.

428
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,530
好吧
Okay.

429
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:40,620
我很想说我记得那一天  但...
I'd like to say I remember that day, but...

430
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,040
我真不记得了
I barely do.

431
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,760
我已经把毒戒了  但...
I'm clean now, finally, but...

432
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,130
我当时是混街头的
I was on the streets then.

433
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:54,100
我还记得你妈临死的模样
I remember her dying, your mom,

434
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,140
还记得我们的孩子
remember the baby.

435
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:02,140
我很想说我记得把你扔在了消防局
I'd like to say I remember leaving you at a fire station,

436
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,970
但我不记得
but I don't.

437
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:05,310
这不是借口
Not an excuse.

438
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:07,990
事实上  这也许说明了我这个人
In fact, it probably tells you something about me

439
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:09,540
记性真的不好
that I don't remember.

440
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:15,330
我确实很喜欢消防局
I do like fire stations, though,

441
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:17,310
所以这确实很像
so that sounds like something I'd do

442
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,140
我在情急之下会干的事
if I had to do something, you know?

443
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:25,740
总之  我不知道你是不是想我赎罪
Anyway, I don't know if that's what you're looking for,

444
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,060
但不管怎样  你大可放心
but either way, you can be sure

445
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,510
我这辈子已经因我的所作所为
this life of mine is punishment enough

446
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:30,590
受到了应有的惩罚
for the things I've done.

447
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,760
-如果你以为我会原谅你  -我没有
- If you think I'm gonna forgive you... - I don't.

448
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,480
你说得对  我就是想说"去你妈的" 
No, you were right. I did just want to say, "Screw you,"

449
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,510
然后甩门而去
and storm out of here.

450
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:39,070
-那你说吧  -去你妈的
- Well, go ahead. - Screw you.

451
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,500
你想见见你的孙女吗
You want to meet your grandchildren?

452
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,290
我去拿外套
I'll get my coat.

453
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,860
孩子
Hey, kid.

454
00:21:58,370 --> 00:21:59,600
你好  艾伦
Hey. Alan.

455
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,540
感谢你能来帮忙
All right. Hey, thanks for doing this, man.

456
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,480
我很感激
I really appreciate it.

457
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,160
说什么啊  我俩不用客气
Oh, please. No thanks necessary.

458
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,020
真的
Trust me.

459
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,900
他们付了我不少钱
They're paying me an absolute fortune.

460
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:10,050
肯定的
I'm sure.

461
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,860
话说回来  你们这现场不错啊
Great scene for you, by the way.

462
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:12,980
-你看到了  -是啊
- You know? - Yeah.

463
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,380
说真的  那混蛋要是想写
Tell ya what, when the prick wants to,

464
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,430
还真能写出点名堂
he can actually write.

465
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,760
是啊
Yeah. Well,

466
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:18,390
咱们片场见
I'll see you out there on the playing field.

467
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,990
祝你好运  孩子
All right. Break a leg, kid.

468
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:20,960
谢谢你  先生
Thank you, sir.

469
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,360
女士们先生们
Ladies and gentlemen,

470
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,130
掌声有请艾伦·锡克
the great Alan Thicke!

471
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:30,150
准备...开始
And... action.

472
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:32,350
我的天
Oh, for God's sake,

473
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,400
我只是想缓和一下气氛
I'm just trying to lighten up the situation here.

474
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,020
我知道  这不就是你常干的事吗
No, I get it. That's what you do, right?

475
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,150
我无足轻重的父亲[双关]My lightweight dad.

476
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:38,380
-儿子...  -别叫我"儿子"
- Son... - Don't call me "Son."

477
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,580
走吧  跟你以往一样
Just go. Just do your thing,

478
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,490
走人吧
get out of here.

479
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:41,540
别这样  儿子
Come on, son...

480
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,820
我说了别叫我"儿子"
I said don't call me "Son."

481
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,290
看着那个小女孩
I-I look at that little girl,

482
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:46,730
为了她我什么都愿意做
I would do anything for her.

483
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,610
你明白吗  如果一辆火车驶来
You understand? Y-You show me a train,

484
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:51,440
我会义无反顾地为她挡在前面
I'll jump in front of it for her, no question.

485
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:54,070
她甚至都不是我亲生的
And she's not even mine.

486
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,430
而你在我过去的三十年生命中
I mean, you... you mosey in and out of my life

487
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:59,500
扮演了一名来去匆匆的过客
the past 30 years like the way you have, I--

488
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:01,670
我不懂你怎么想的  我也永远不会懂
I don't understand that and I'll never understand you,

489
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:02,970
所以你赶紧从我眼前消失
so just get the hell out of here.

490
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:06,050
快走
Just get out.

491
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:11,460
我希望你离开这里
I want you to get out and this time,

492
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,220
也希望你别再插足我的人生了
I want you to stay the hell out of my life, okay?

493
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,450
-儿子  -滚
- Son... - Leave!

494
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:25,230
卡
And cut!

495
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,790
他们肯定觉得咱俩表演很成功
All right, they must think we did it.

496
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,800
-是你的功劳  -谢谢
- You did it. - Thank you.

497
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,840
你表现得非常棒
You were fa-- you killed.

498
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,260
-谢谢你来帮我  -太棒了
- Thank you for being here. - Excellent.

499
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,640
现在可以发我工钱了吗
Hey, may I have the envelope, please?

500
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,560
行了
Oh, come on.

501
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,320
你在那里干什么  快过来抱一个
There, what are you doing, come on, get in here.

502
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,840
怎么样  我说会成功的吧
See, I told you, right? I told you!

503
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,050
太棒了  凯文
That's so good, Kevin.

504
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:52,280
这感觉真好
Oh... That felt good.

505
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,390
现在我们只需要
Now all we need to do is just

506
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,600
赶紧把切换镜头拍了
take a quick whack at the alt pass, huh?

507
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:55,820
拜托  我们不需要拍切换镜头
Oh, come on, we don't need an alt pass,

508
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:56,790
你在说啥呢  为什么你...
what are you talking about? Why would you--

509
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:57,710
拍来干嘛
wh-wh-what, for what?

510
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:59,590
凯文  行了  我们已经谈过了
Kevin, come on, we talked about this.

511
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:01,700
刚才这段很精彩  剧本就是我写的
You know? I loved it-- I-I wrote it,

512
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:02,230
但说真的
you know?

513
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:06,110
我们得再拍一个更轻松的版本
But, um, we just got to, we got to get a lighter version.

514
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:07,360
来吧
Come on.

515
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:09,050
把它拍完
Let's get that alt.

516
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:10,450
就当为了我  好吗
For me, okay?

517
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:13,110
对了  把上衣脱掉吧
And, uh, lose the shirt.

518
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,380
不穿衣服效果会更好
It's just better without the shirt.

519
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,010
但愿你们"饿"了
I hope you're hungry,

520
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:22,860
因为我们为你们准备了"披萨"[肉体]'cause we got some pizza for you!

521
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,490
每个人都喜欢"披萨"
Everybody loves pizza!

522
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,880
好吧
All right.

523
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:51,130
没事  大家不用惊慌
No, it's okay. No, no. Nobody be alarmed.

524
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:52,620
别惊慌  这不是真的婴儿
Nobody be alarmed, this isn't a real baby.

525
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:53,780
这个"婴儿"没有知觉
This baby can't feel a thing,

526
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,590
因为一切都是假的
because everything's fake!

527
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:58,290
上帝不准我们在节目中表现真实的情感
God forbid we have real emotion in this show.

528
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,870
这是个什么东西
What do we got here?

529
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:00,910
这里有个真的行李箱
We got a real suitcase.

530
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,560
咱们终于有一样东西是真的了
Finally, we got something real.

531
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,400
不  并不是
Oh, no, we don't!

532
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:06,120
看啊  行李箱里面什么都没有
Look, there's nothing in the suitcase!

533
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:08,830
你到底要去哪啊  艾伦·锡克
Where the hell are you going, Alan Thicke?

534
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:10,810
你到了那里以后
And what the hell are you gonna wear,

535
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,820
要穿什么啊
when you get there? Huh?

536
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:14,580
他行李箱里一件衣服都没有
He's got no clothes in the suitcase!

537
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:15,780
你们知道吗  我现在开始思考这一切
You know what it is, I'm starting to think about things

538
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:17,040
事实上  凯西
about things now. It's actually... Casey,

539
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,100
这不是你的错  兄弟
it's not your fault, brother.

540
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:18,910
节目这么烂
It's not the writer's fault

541
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:20,090
不怪编剧
this show is so bad.

542
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:22,870
但它实在是太烂了
And it's so bad!

543
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,170
这也不是电视台播出的错
It's not the network's fault for airing it!

544
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:26,900
是你们的错
It's you guys!

545
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:28,610
你们为什么要看这种烂玩意
Why are you watching this stuff?

546
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,080
正是因为你们的要求太低了
It's your fault for demanding so little of us

547
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,310
我们才安于现状
that we settle.

548
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,540
我感觉自己的脸都快丢尽了
I can't feel my face right now,

549
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:36,480
但你们知道吗
but you know what?

550
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:37,770
当我接受这份工作的时候
I knew exactly what this job was

551
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:38,730
就知道它的内容
when I took it.

552
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,510
赚这种钱的我真可耻
Shame on me for taking the money!

553
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:42,570
把我捧上天的你们也真可耻
Shame on you for making me famous!

554
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:43,930
我们都很可耻
Shame on all of us!

555
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:47,670
够了
That's enough.

556
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:48,900
你在...
What are you...

557
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,050
我又不会揍你  兄弟
I'm not gonna hit you, man.

558
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,610
我不会揍你
I'm not gonna hit you!

559
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:54,860
你把我当成什么暴力分子了吗
What do you... you think I'm some kind of animal?

560
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,310
我只是快被逼疯了而已
I'm just gonna go nuts!

561
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,370
听我说
Listen,

562
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,520
瑞安·高斯林不会接这种烂剧
Ryan Gosling may not do this crap,

563
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:02,220
我也不会接
and neither will I.

564
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:05,650
我不干了
I quit...

565
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:07,850
我不干了
I quit.

566
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:13,520
很高兴能跟您合作  我是您的忠实粉丝
Great working with you, man. I'm a huge fan.

567
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:15,400
没错  刚刚挺开心的
Yeah, that was a lot of fun.

568
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,900
丽贝卡  再使把劲
All right, Rebecca, one more big push, now.

569
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,420
就是这样
There you go...

570
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:30,020
-用劲  -加油  小贝
- Keep pushing! - Come on, Bec.

571
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:31,290
好了
All right!

572
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:32,310
好了
All right.

573
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:33,920
大儿子出来了
First male is out,

574
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:35,870
他很健康
and he is looking good!

575
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:37,290
你听到了吗  宝贝
You hear that, baby?

576
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:38,330
我们生了个男孩  我们生了个男孩
We got a boy! We got a boy!

577
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:40,310
我们生了个男孩
We got a boy!

578
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:41,670
谢谢你的努力  女士
Thank you, ma'am.

579
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,370
-宝贝  -有些不对劲
- Baby? - Something's not right.

580
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:44,680
我感觉有些不对劲
There's something's not right.

581
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,270
医生
Doctor?

582
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,910
护士给她戴下氧气罩
Some oxygen for her, please?

583
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:50,100
丽贝卡  你做得很好  甜心
Rebecca? You've done real good, sweetheart,

584
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,070
但现在你得休息一会儿
but we need to let you get some rest right now

585
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,960
我可能要换种方式给你接生  好吗
and let's see if I can't take it from here, okay?

586
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,640
不好意思  怎么了
I'm sorry, what's happening?

587
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,430
我要进里面去
I'm gonna have to go in

588
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:57,060
接生另外两个宝宝  走吧
for the other two people, let's go.

589
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:58,890
你妻子现在情况不妙  杰克
Your wife is in distress, Jack.

590
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:01,010
此时此刻  你得相信我
Now, right now, you just need to trust me

591
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:02,340
别妨碍我做事
and get the hell out of my way.

592
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:04,160
-等等  我...  -赶紧把他弄出去
- No, wait, but I'm... - Get him out of the room, now.

593
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:05,290
稳住
Stat.

594
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:10,380
-孩子们  -爸爸
- Guys? - Daddy!

595
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,420
亲爱的  你去帮安妮看看作业
Hey, babe, I need you to help Annie with her homework...

596
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,620
孩子们
Guys...

597
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:22,720
这位是你们的...
this is your, uh...

598
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,130
威廉
William.

599
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,150

很高兴认识你  贝丝
It's a pleasure meeting you, Beth.

605
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:37,660
你的裤子破了个洞
You have a hole in your pants.

606
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,230
安妮
Annie!

607
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:40,360
没关系  确实如此
Oh, that's okay. I actually do.

608
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,710
年轻人不都觉得这样很酷吗
Hey, isn't that what the kids do to be cool?

609
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:44,340
他们把裤子剪出洞  对吧
They put holes in their pants, right?

610
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,710
但不是这样的
Not like that.

611
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,120
原来是这样  我还以为这样很酷
Well, here I was, thought I was being cool.

612
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,510
那要是我这样呢  哟  你好啊
Wait, what if I do this? Yo, what's going...

613
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,010
-不酷  -不
- No. - No.

614
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,460
我的天  你一定就是苔丝
My, my, my, you must be Tess.

615
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,420
-是的  -我听说你踢足球...
- Yes. - I hear you play soccer...

616
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:01,000
我应该提前打电话的
I should have called.

617
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,620
但我不知道怎么开这个口
I didn't know how to say it out loud.

618
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:03,990
-所以你干脆就...  -我...
- So, you just... - I...

619
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:05,720
我没办法解释  宝贝
I have no explanation, baby.

620
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:07,940
不管我想说他什么
Like, everything I want to say

621
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,970
对他做什么  到最后都背道而驰
or do around this man, I do the opposite.

622
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,540
就像狗血的情景喜剧
It's like a bad sitcom.

623
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,790
就好像《靓男保姆》或者《怎么了》
It's like an episode of The Man-ny

624
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:15,200
里面的剧情
or What's Happening!!

625
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,070
他把我扔在消防局
He left me at a fire station

626
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:21,050
我却请他来我们家
and I invited him into our home.

627
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:25,840
天啊  亲爱的  你突然大笑干嘛
Oh, my God, baby, you're cracking up.

628
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:27,830
爸爸
Daddy?

629
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,130
你怎么了
What's happening?

630
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:32,020
怎么了
What's happening?

631
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,820
-别开玩笑  -是真的
- You're not serious. - I am.

632
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,070
什么  萨丽·菲尔德
Wait, Sally Field?

633
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:45,380
是的  我喜欢萨丽·菲尔德  告我啊
Yeah. I have a thing for Sally Field. Sue me.

634
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,470
她差不多六十岁了吧
She's, like, 60.

635
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:49,380
六十岁是性感新潮  你不知道吗
60 is the new sexy. You didn't know that?

636
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,710
等她七十的时候...
And when she turns 70...

637
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,040
可要当心了
Look out,

638
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,990
萨丽七十多岁会登上性感的巅峰
Sally is gonna peak in her 70s.

639
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:57,960
我保证

640
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,050
-好啊  -能向两位推荐甜点吗
- Yeah... - Can I interest you in dessert?

641

00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:05,020
-不要  -可以
- No! - Yes.

645
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:05,920
他刚才问的是
He was just asking

646
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,300
他能不能给我们推荐甜品
if he could interest us in dessert.

647
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,760
我同意了
I am saying that he can.

648
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,630
我对甜品非常感兴趣
I am very interested in dessert.

649
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,720
我对甜品深深地着迷
I am utterly fascinated by dessert.

650
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,450
甜品是我一生的挚爱
Dessert is my life's work.

651
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,400
所以
So...

652
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,100

-谢谢  -谢谢
- Thank you. - Thank you.

655
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,610
我一般不喜欢意大利炖饭
I don't normally like risotto,

656
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:24,860
但如果你把它捏成团  再下锅炸
but if you put it in a ball form, and-and deep fry it,

657
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,450
我能吃上一千个
I can eat, like, a thousand of them.

658
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:30,020
今晚过得很开心  托比

00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,040
等一下  不不不
Wait, what? No, no, no.

661
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,050
这就完了吗
What, that's it?

662
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,310
什么意思
What do you mean?

663
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:38,140
你不想请我进去...
I mean, you're not gonna invite me in for a...

664
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:40,300
喝上一杯或者...
a nightcap or...

665
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:42,650
帮我做一次手活吗
a handy or something?

666
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,210

671
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:06,020
我们已经喝了三四两酒了
We have already had our six ounces of wine.

672
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:06,640
我知道
I know.

673
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,390
大约含150卡路里
150 calories per six ounce.

674
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:09,870
是啊
Yeah.

675
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,580
你再这样算热量
You keep counting calories,

676
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:13,580
我可真要性奋了
and you're gonna really turn me on.

677
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:14,490
是啊
Yeah.

678
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:17,160
你想知道一根香肠含多少卡路里吗
You want to know how many, uh, calories are in a sausage?

679
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,710
{\an8}友善的海豚

680
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:20,410
这...  这合法吗
Is... but is it even legal?

681
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:22,230
在我们国家不合法
No. Not in this country.

682
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,230
你想来一炮吗
Do you want to fool around?

683
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,010
不想
I don't.

684
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,830
-好吧  -不  我...
- Okay. - No, I...

685
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:35,810

跟我提出这种要求了
since this has even been an option.

688
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:43,600
我懂的
Hey. I know, I know.

689
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,170

我36岁了
I am 36.

并且...
And, um...

692

我这个样子
this...

693
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:58,360
并不是很养眼
is not a very pretty picture.

694
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,800
-没关系的  -不...
- It's okay. - No, it's...

695
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,860
没事的
Hey, it's okay.

696
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,870

为什么你不接电话
Why don't you answer your phone?

698
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,570

等等  你说啥
Wait, what?

707
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:28,030
你都不上社交软件的吗

-什么意思  怎...  -你该看看

你要为我感到骄傲  好吗
I want you to know you would've been proud of me, okay?

我就是艺术良知的化身
I was the picture of artistic integrity.

713
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:40,750
你能脱了上衣跟我拍一张吗
Could we do one without your shirt on?

714
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:52,600
{\an9}号外  靓男保姆失控辞演

715
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,360
好莱坞今日大新闻

716
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:47,060
《靓男保姆》录制现场失控
the Man-ny's on-set meltdown.

717
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:48,520
我想了想就觉得
Think about this, I'm like, you know,

718
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,340
其实节目这么烂
it's actually not the writer's fault

719
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,760
不怪编剧
that this show is so awful.

720
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:57,830
我觉得艾伦·锡克挺可怜的
Wow. I actually kind of feel bad for Alan Thicke.

721
00:31:58,590 --> 00:31:59,380
是啊
Yeah.

722

丽贝卡生命体征正常
Rebecca's vitals are good.

723

她还会再睡一段时间
She's gonna be asleep for a little while,

724
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:14,600
她不会有事的  我们时刻监测着她
but she's doing fine. We're monitoring her closely.

725
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:15,650
好
Okay.

726
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:20,360
我们失去了第三个孩子  杰克

我很遗憾
I'm-I'm very sorry.

00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,170

第二个孩子是个女孩  很强壮

第三个孩子是个小男孩
The third baby was a little boy,

731
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:34,690
但他的脖子被脐带勒住了
but the, uh, umbilical cord was cutting off his oxygen.

732
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:37,420
胎死腹中  谁也无力回天
He was stillborn. Nothing anybody could've done.

733
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:45,050
抱歉  我现在脑子一片混乱
I'm sorry, I'm... I'm not processing anything.

734
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,560
-我妻子呢  -她没事
- My wife? - Is fine.

735
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:49,040
她很快就会醒过来
And she'll be awake pretty soon.

736
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:53,700
你有了两个健康漂亮的孩子  杰克

00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:00,810
但我们失去了第三个孩子
But we did lose the third child.

但她现在需要睡一觉
But she needs to sleep now.

742
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:20,320
不会很久  你先坐下
But soon. You just sit down.

00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,540
坐吧
Sit. Sit.

744
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:29,440
我能陪你坐会儿吗
Okay if I keep you company a second?

745
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:31,890
好
Yeah.

746
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:41,040
我能...
Okay if I...

747
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:43,440
跟你分享一些人生心得吗

好

癌症

751
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:57,510
所以我这把年纪了还在卖力工作
That's the reason I still work so much at my age.

752
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:01,140
只是想消磨时间
Just... trying to pass the time.

753
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:06,570
我们结婚53年
We were married 53 years.

754
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,920
五个孩子  十一个孙子
Five children, 11 grandkids.

755
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,850
但我们失去了第一胎
But we lost our very first child

756
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,140
接生时夭折的
during the delivery.

757
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:23,370
说实话  这就是我从事这个行业的原因
The reason I went into this field, truth be told...

758
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:29,280
我干接生干了五十年了
I have spent five decades delivering babies.

759
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,920
接生过的孩子多得数不过来
More babies than I can count.

760
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,920
但还是没有哪一天
But there is not a single day that goes by

761
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:41,300
我没想起我那死去的孩子的
that I don't think of the child I lost.

762
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:44,570
现在我老了
And I'm an old man now.

763
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:55,330
我想正是因为我失去的这个孩子
I like to think that because of the child that I lost,

764
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,040
因为他让我...
because of the path that...

765
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,930
选择了这条路
that he sent me on,

766
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:03,400
我才能救回数不胜数的孩子
that I have saved countless other babies.

767
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,270
是的
Yeah.

768
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,950
我想也许有一天
I like to think that maybe one day

769
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:12,660
你会变成像我这样的老人...
you'll be an old man like me...

770
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:19,930
并向一位年轻人娓娓道来
talking a younger man's ear off, explaining to him

771
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:21,010
你是如何...
how you...

772
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:25,840
将生活带给你柠檬般的酸楚
took the sourest lemon that life has to offer...

773
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,130
酿成犹如柠檬汽水般的甘甜
and turned it into something resembling lemonade.

774
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:35,080
如果你能做到  那你还是...
If you can do that, then you will still be...

775
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:38,250
还是能从医院带走三个孩子
taking three babies home from this hospital.

776
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:39,500
只是
Just...

777
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,380
跟你的计划稍有偏差而已
maybe not the way you planned.

778
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:51,070
我不知道这话是否有意义  还是我老糊涂了
I don't know if that was meaningful or senile,

779
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:52,860
但我觉得应该告诉你
but I thought it ought to be said.

780
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,010
你妻子还要再睡一会儿
Your wife'll still be asleep for a little while.

781
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,830
去看你的孩子吧
Go see your babies.

782
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:08,330
他们很期待见到自己的父亲
They're excited to meet their father.

783
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:14,010
他们也许摊上个好父亲
I think maybe they got a good one.

784
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,950
不好意思  得哄孩子们去睡觉
Sorry. Just had to put the girls down.

785
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:33,410
-他们是你的...-我父母
- These people, they're your... - My parents.

786
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:35,240
我的养父母
Well, my adopted.

787
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,360
就是我父母
They're my parents.

788
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,320
你一直跟他们生活在一起吗
You've been with them your whole life?

789
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:42,060
一直都是
From the start.

790
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,300
一个消防员发现了我
A fireman found me.

791
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:47,800
把我送到医院  他们当时也在那
He took me to the hospital, and they were there.

792
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,360
他们说这是命中注定的
They said it felt meant to be.

793
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,480
我想可能是我命好吧
Just one of those lucky breaks, I guess.

794
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:57,380
消防局
A fire station.

795
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,490
天  我竟然把孩子扔在那
Gee, what a thing to have done.

796
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,880
我该走了
I should get going.

797
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,340
你可以时不时过来看看...
Maybe we could have you by every once... ?

798
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:06,640
不  我想不必了
No, I don't think that's necessary.

799
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:07,760
不是非逼你来... 
It's no pressure. I just...

800
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,960
只是我...
It's just that I'm...

801
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:11,720
只是我快死了
I'm dying, is all.

802
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:14,490
你病了吗
You're sick?

803
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,880
是要死了  不是病了
Dying, not sick.

804
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:17,810
发病是几个月前的事
Sick was months ago.

805
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:20,460
不幸的是  我快死了
I'm toward the end, fortunately.

806
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:27,320
我不知道该说什么
I don't know what to say.

807
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,770
什么都不用说
No, there's nothing to be said.

808
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:32,510
谢谢你对我这么仁慈
It was a kindness you've shown me,

809
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:35,210
邀我过来见你的家人
letting me meet them.

810
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,270
想必你爸一直都以你为傲
Your dad must've been very proud of you.

811
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,380
我竟然喝了这么多卡路里
I cannot believe that I'm drinking these calories.

812
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,500
我都把自己的前程给毁了
Since I just torpedoed my career,

813
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,850
我想就算你多摄入点
I think you can afford an extra,

814
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:15,600
一百还是多少卡路里又怎样
you know, 100 calories or whatever.

815
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:17,260
-150  -是150
- 150. - It's 150.

816
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:23,290
如果我只能接《靓男保姆》这种戏怎么办
What if I'm not better than The Man-ny?

817
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:28,920
如果我就是这种水平呢
What if I am exactly "Man-ny good"?

818
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:34,790
我不知道我以后要干什么
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

819
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:39,910
去百老汇
Broadway.

820
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:42,860
我唱歌不行
Can't sing.

821
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,550
拍黄片吧
Porn.

822
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:46,690
也许行吧
Yeah, maybe.

823
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:50,480
我要再来点酒了
I'm gonna get some more of this red.

824
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:54,520
我遇上大麻烦了
I'm in so much trouble.

825
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,320
我完了
I am screwed.

826

听着  凯文
Listen, okay, Kevin...

827
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,870
还记得以前每当我们遭遇不顺
Do you remember what Dad used to say?

828
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,700
老爸是怎么说的吗
When something crappy would happen to us?

829
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,430
当我们失意沮丧
Whenever we'd get down,

830
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:21,390
感觉生活不尽如人意时说的话
whenever we felt like life wasn't going our way?

831
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,140
哪个是你的孩子
Which one's yours?

832
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:26,610

Those two.

833

恭喜啊  双胞胎
Congrats! Twins.

834

How about you? Which one's yours?

00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:33,970
都不是
None of 'em, actually.

836
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,800
奇了怪了
Strangest damn thing.

837
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:38,700
有人把一个新生儿丢在了消防局
Someone left a newborn at my fire station.

838
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,970
我不知道该怎么办  就送来医院了
I didn't know what to do, so I brought him here.

839
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,020
抽烟吗
Smoke?

840
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:53,080
不用了  谢谢
No. Thank you.

841
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:01,660

他怎么说的
What did he say?

847
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:28,240
就柠檬那句
About the lemons?

848
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,650
-没有柠檬能酸到...-酸到...
- There's no lemon so sour... - So sour...

849
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:36,750
令你做不出美味的柠檬汽水

00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:43,390
准备...
And...

46
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:45,140
-最开始...  -是我
- First came... - Me!

47
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,490
-爸爸说...  -天哪
- And Dad said... - Gee!

48
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:47,540
-然后呢...  -是我
- And then came... - Me!

49
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,830
-妈妈说...  -妈呀
- And Mom said... - Whee!

50
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,480
-最后呢...  -是我
- And then came... - Me.

51
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,270
-我们说...  -三个了
- And we said... - That's three.

52
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:54,980
-三个小家伙  -三个小家伙
- Big Three? - Big Three!

53
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,690
要我告诉你我的嘴在哪里吗
Do you need me to show you where my mouth is?

54
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:03,920
不用
No.

55
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:05,700
我知道在哪
I know where it is.

56
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,180
行
Good.

57
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,190
-再见  -拜拜
- Bye. - Bye.

58
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,830
凯特  水果都吃掉
Kate, all the fruit, please.

59
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,450
你好呀
What's up?

60
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,400
我练了肱二头肌  肱三头肌  和左边蛋蛋
You know, I just did bi's, tri's and left testicle.

61
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,530
我发现那家伙有不少恶趣味
I'm really starting to get some definition on that guy.

62
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:44,220
-行了  不好笑  -好笑啊...
- Stop. Not funny. - It's fun...

63
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,750
-不好笑  -行了  能走了吗
- It's not funny. - Come on. Come on, can we go?

64
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,030
我们已经练了很久了
We've been here long enough.

65
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:49,460
-不  -凯特  来嘛  走吧
- No... - Kate. Come on, Kate... Come on.

66
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,210
为什么你瘦了  而我没有
How are you losing weight and I'm not?

67
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:59,020
我能说实话吗
Can I be honest with you?

68
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,560
说啊
Yeah, please.

69
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:03,690
可能是因为我比你认真吧
I think I'm just taking this more seriously than you are.

70
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,190
好啦  走吧
Come on. Let's go.

71
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,460
世上最糟糕的地方
Worst place in the world!

72
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,400
亲爱的
Baby?

73
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,460
怎么
Yeah.

74
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:30,470
我想问你个事  可...
I want to ask you something, but...

75
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,360
不知该怎么说
I'm not sure how to say it.

76
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:36,530
从什么时候开始  我们要互相检讨了
Since when do we censor ourselves with each other?

77
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:37,560
不  不是...
No, I know, it's...

78
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,130
贝丝  我们在一起十七年了
You know, Beth, we've been together for 17 years.

79
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,370
几乎过了半辈子
That's almost half our lives.

80
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,460
我懂你的表情
I know your face,

81
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:47,620
你的双手  你的心思
your hands, your soul

82
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,230
我对你的了解比对自己还多
better than I know my own.

83
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:51,870
你不必检讨自己
You don't have to censor yourself.

84
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,710
在我面前  永远不必
Ever. Not with me.

85
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,540
你想问什么
What was your question?

86
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,830
你这位吸毒的亲生父亲
How long is your crack-addict biological daddy

87
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:01,680
要在咱们六岁的女儿房里住多久
gonna be sleeping in our six-year-old daughter's bedroom?

88
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,300
-我去  -我就说吧
- Damn. - I know, right?

89
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,680
你要检讨一下自己  女人
You need to censor yourself, woman.

90
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,120
被我说中了吧
It's just got real.

91
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,610
可是兰德尔  他已经住了三天
But Randall, he's been here for three days.

92
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:14,780
女儿们现在还以为他只是你的一位
And the girls still think he's your 70-year-old co-worker

93
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,460
喜欢在别人家过夜的七十岁老同事
who likes sleepovers.

94
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,470
最后我们要怎么办
What's our endgame here?

95
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:22,030
贝丝  他得了晚期胃癌
Beth, the man has Stage 4 stomach cancer.

96
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,500
我只想带他找医生做个初步检查
I'm just trying to get him to his first doctor's appointment,

97
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,790
确保他能挺过周四
make sure he's gonna make it past Thursday.

98
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,930
其他事到时候我们再说
Then we can take the rest from there.

99
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,720
好吗
Okay?

100
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,490
好  当然可以
Yeah. Okay.

101
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:44,240
顺便说一句  他是"曾经"吸过毒
And he's a former crack addict, by the way.

102
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,960
那他就住到天长地久吧
Oh, well, then he can stay forever.

103
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,300
瞧见没  你想都不想就这么说
See? You didn't even think about that.

104
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,960
最近丽贝卡很生气
So now Rebecca's all worked up

105
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,020
因为学校的孩子们叫他"白家黑"
because the kids at school are calling him "Webster".

106
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,590
你看过白人家庭
You know, the black kid

107
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,520
收养黑人小孩的那个剧吗
the white family adopts on that show?

108
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,690
我喜欢那个剧
I love that show.

109
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,260
我不明白  米格尔  只是...
I don't know. I don't know, Miguel, it's just...

110
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:10,030
有时候我觉得看不到原来的她了
It's hard to see the woman I married sometimes, you know?

111
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,320
在想什么
What?

112
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:22,700
-没什么  -没什么
- Nothing. - Nothing.

113
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,010
真的没什么  你...
Nothing. You...

114
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:24,620
我是你最好的朋友
I'm your, I'm your best friend.

115
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,840
你只是发牢骚而已
You're venting.

116
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:29,030
好朋友会倾听彼此发泄  不说三道四
Best friends let best friends vent without judgment.

117
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:31,390
就算刚过五点你已经喝了两杯酒
I'm not even gonna say anything about it being 5:03

118
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,220
我也不会说什么
and that being your second bourbon.

119
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,570
谢谢理解
I appreciate that.

120
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:35,750
问题是...
The thing is...

121
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,910
你老婆是个标准的好媳妇
your wife is, like, the gold standard of wives.

122
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:41,560
我知道  米格尔
I know, Miguel.

123
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,040
她聪明  有趣  又很漂亮
I mean, she's smart, funny, beautiful,

124
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,790
-性格好  身材也好...  -悠着点
- great personality, greater ass... - Easy.

125
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,650
她养的不是一个两个
She's raising not one, not two,

126
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:50,350
而是三个八岁大的孩子
but three eight-year-olds

127
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,270
可你却在这儿一杯接一杯地喝酒
while you sit here drinking not one, not two,

128
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:56,280
刚过五点第三杯就要下肚
but soon to be three bourbons by 5:05.

129
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,450
这些我都懂  米格尔
I know all this, Miguel.

130
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:59,670
-你懂吗  -我懂
- Yeah? - Yeah.

131
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,300
因为作为你最忠实的好朋友
Because as your loyal best friend,

132
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,700
我有责任告诉你现在是什么状况
it is my duty to remind you of what you've got there.

133
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,930
娶到她  你是大大的高攀了
You married way, way above your station.

134
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,580
建议你别让她意识到这一点
I'd be careful not to give her a reason to notice.

135
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,800
我老爸不是好人
Oh, my father, he wasn't a very nice man.

136
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,440
他跟你们的爸爸不一样
He wasn't like your father.

137
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:20,730
为什么
Why not?

138
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:23,290
你们的爸爸很优秀
Well, your father, he's good.

139
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,480
没有恶习
He doesn't have vices.

140
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:27,380
你们明白恶习是什么吗
You know what a vice is?

141
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,960
恶习是种坏习惯
A vice is like a bad habit,

142
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,550
比如咬指甲  但是更严重
like bitin' your nails, but worse.

143
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,720
-比如吸毒  -没错  差不多
- Like drugs? - Yeah, that's right.

144
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,210
那是我的恶习
That was my vice.

145
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,980
你从哪弄来毒品的呢
Where would you get drugs?

146
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,290
这是个好问题  苔丝
Well, that's an interesting question, Tess.

147
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:42,370
让我想想
Let's see...

148
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:43,870
我曾经吸的可卡因...
Well, the cocaine I used to...

149
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:44,710
-好了  可以了  -好了  孩子们
- OK. That's good. - Okay, kids.

150
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:45,890
我们得准备上学了
Let's get ready for school, okay?

151
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:46,950
快点
Come on.

152
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,890
我有个好消息
Hey, so I got good news.

153
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:52,160
我给你预约了一个免疫疗法的专家
I got you an appointment with an immunotherapy specialist.

154
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,130
-不用麻烦了  -不  这没什么
- Oh, that's not necessary. - No, it was nothing.

155
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,750
我公司的同事有门路
Guy at my firm had an in.

156
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,590
这人做了不少突破性研究
This guy is doing some really ground-breaking stuff.

157
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:00,100
谢谢  那太好了
Thank you, that's very kind.

158
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,230
应该的
You got it.

159
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:02,600
来吧  宝贝
Oh, hey, come on, baby.

160
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,970
深吸一口  好吗
I need you to take one big, deep breath for me, okay?

161
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,060
很好
Oh, that's good.

162
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,250
可以了
All right.

163
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,750
我的恶习是哮喘
My vice is asthma.

164
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,860
他的是可卡因
His is cocaine.

165
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,040
好了  把外套带上
All right, so let's get our jackets.

166
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,410
去拿上你的衣服
Go and get your coat.

167
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:19,150
甜心  拿好你的午饭
Honey, here, take your lunch.

168
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:21,570
去吧
Here you go.

169
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:23,530
对不起
Hey, I'm sorry.

170
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,540
我知道现在跟她们说可卡因太早了
I know they're too young to talk about cocaine.

171
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,300
我只是...
I just...

172
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,560
六岁吸可卡因是不是太早了
I feel like six is a hair young for cocaine...

173
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,310
没错  等到了七岁再让她们试试
Yeah, but seven... We let them try it at seven.

174
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:34,250
今天你去做什么  威廉
Um, so... what are you up to today, William?

175
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,190
没什么事  跟平时一样
Oh, nothing much. The usual.

176
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,000
能待在这里我真的很开心
I've really enjoyed being here.

177
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,910
跟孩子们在一起  让我觉得很满足
Being around those girls-- it fills me in a way...

178
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,090
但我不配过得这么幸福  所以
in a way I surely don't deserve, so...

179
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,990
如果我待太久给你们添麻烦了
I hope you'll let me know

180
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,050
希望你们要及时告诉我
when I've overstayed my welcome.

181
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,030
别说傻话
You know, don't be silly.

182
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,610
我们很高兴你能留下
We're happy to have you.

183
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,950
那我们就不打扰你了
We'll let you get on with your day.

184
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,040
冒昧问一句  我能不能
I was wondering if I could be so forward

185
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,070
问你们要几美元坐公车
as to ask you for a few dollars for the bus.

186
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:02,040
没事  应该的
Oh, sure. Sure.

187
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,830
你要去哪里
Where you going?

188
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:10,510
随便转转
Oh, you know, just around.

189
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,050
维克多  我的兄弟
Victor. My man.

190
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:33,890
你还好吗
How you been?

191
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:36,020
-我是赫克托  -对极了
- I've been Hector. - Right on. Yeah.

192
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,920
对不起  最近事情有点多
Yeah, and I'm sorry. I got a lot on my mind.

193
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,390
不知道你听说了吗  我离开剧组了
I don't know if you heard the news. I left the show.

194
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,530
今天我就是来和团队开会的
Yeah. I'm gonna meet with the team today.

195
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:44,220
制订接下来的计划
You know, we're gonna strategize, talk next steps.

196
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:45,550
好多东西需要解决  好多东西要谈
Lots to figure out, lots to talk about.

197
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:46,260
太激动了
It's exciting.

198
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,150
对所有人来说都是激动人心的时刻
Exciting times for everyone involved.

199
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:54,960
凯文
Kevin,

200
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,240
你还记得当初我是在哪找到你的吗
do you remember where you were when I found you?

201
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,270
当然  我当时在一个即兴喜剧剧团
Yeah, sure. I was, uh, in an improv comedy troupe.

202
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,190
没错
That's right.

203
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:03,070
当我看到你的第一场表演
And when I saw your first show,

204
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,580
你知道我想的是什么吗  凯文
do you know what I thought to myself, Kevin?

205
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:10,940
-不知道  -我想的是  我做到了
- No, I-I... - I thought to myself... I've done it.

206
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:16,440
我找到了这世上最不搞笑的人
I have found the least funny person on the entire planet.

207
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:18,760
好吧
Okay.

208
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,090
但我看到了别的闪光点
But I saw something there,

209
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:21,420
所以我带走了你
so I took you on.

210
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:24,050
我给你接了广告
And I got you the commercials,

211
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,640
帮你接肥皂剧
got you the soaps,

212
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,400
我还帮你找到一份
eventually got you a job paying you

213
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:30,200
年薪三百万的工作
almost three million dollars a year,

214
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,030
让你名声大噪  就算你在室外27度时
making you so famous that you could wear a ski cap

215
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:38,910
戴着滑雪帽  也没人会说三道四
when it is 80 degrees outside, and no one would say a damn thing.

216
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:39,730
好了  蕾妮
Okay, Lanie...

217
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,510
把帽子摘了
Take off that hat.

218
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,080
好吧
Okay.

219
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,870
木已成舟  不是吗
What's done is done, right?

220
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,540
我们能不能就...
I mean, you know, can't we just...

221
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,530
别再提了
move on?

222
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:55,080
布莱恩  说话
Brian... speak.

223
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:59,490
你跟节目组签的合同还有两年才到期
You're contractually bound to the show for another two years.

224
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,060
好吧
Okay.

225
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,730
好吧  如果我不演呢
All right, and if I refuse?

226
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:09,750
好了  仔细听我说  凯文
Right, listen to me very carefully, Kevin.

227
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,780
电视网是你的老板
The network owns you.

228
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:13,610
他们会起诉你赔偿损失
They can sue you for damages.

229
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,110
他们会让你倾家荡产
They could bankrupt you.

230
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:17,150
即使有人往他们公共饮用水里
And even if someone slipped a chill pill

231
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,820
放了镇静药
into their collective drink,

232
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:23,460
在法律约束下  你未来两年也无法工作
you would still be legally unable to work for the next two years.

233
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:26,780
无论是在哪家工作室  电视网
That's for any studio, any network.

234
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,660
电视剧或是电影
Television or film.

235
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,450
所以...
So...

236
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,790
以上是好消息
that's the good news.

237
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,910
下面要说的这部分你不会喜欢
Now here's the part you're not gonna like.

238
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:40,480
她今晚要在她家
She's throwing this big...

239
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,470
举办一个大型好莱坞派对  对吗
Hollywood party at her house tonight, right?

240
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:44,100
电视网总裁和很多人会到场
The network president's gonna be there, everyone.

241
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,770
我要到过去  五体投地恳请他们
I'm supposed to show up, get down on my hands and knees

242
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:49,370
让我继续演《靓男保姆》
and beg to be the Manny again. Yeah.

243
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:53,860
他们是我老板  妹妹  我不知道该怎么办
They own me, Sis. I don't know what I'm gonna do.

244
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,890
我知道  并且你已经做了
Well, I do, and you did it already.

245
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:59,260
需要我给你看那段网上的视频吗
Do you need me to show you the video on YouTube?

246
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,050
不用了
No.

247
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:05,600
凯文  我都认识你一辈子了
Kevin, I've known you your whole life.

248
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:08,270
除了最初的那两分钟
Well, except for those two minutes at the beginning.

249
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:12,100
你努力的每件事都成功了
You've succeed at everything you've ever tried.

250
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:15,080
所以接下来这样  好吗
So here's what's gonna happen. Okay?

251
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,920
你去参加那派对
You're gonna go to that party,

252
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:18,710
大步走向那电视网老总
and you're gonna march up to that network guy,

253
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,950
然后大声说"奶爸不干了"
and you're gonna tell him, "Manny out!"

254
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,810
"奶爸不干了"
Manny out?

255
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,410
奶爸不干了  奶爸不干了
Manny out. Manny out!

256
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:27,230
你不该那样说...  好吧
Well, you're not supposed to say the... Okay.

257
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:29,730
奶爸不干了  真不错
Manny out! That's good.

258
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,620
问你个问题
Let me ask you a question.

259
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:38,120
在你没出生的头两分钟里  我是怎么过的
What did I ever do those first two minutes without you?

260
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,840
你嚎啕大哭  还像个"搅屎棍"
Oh, you cried, and you crapped a lot.

261
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:43,850
听起来是我的风格
Sounds about right. Yeah.

262
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:47,390
你今晚会和我一起去派  对吧
So you're coming to the party, though, tonight with me, right?

或是  奶爸不干了
Or maybe Manny out!

274
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,430
管他呢  怎样都行
Whatever... whatever works.

275
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:15,710
{\an8}我们的生活
第一季  第二集

276
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,960
水蔓延开来
The water exhales

277
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:21,860
当微风拂动
and when the wind blows

278
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,080
便又是另一番景色了
the landscape is altered

279
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:27,000
这只豹一定...
this pard must be...

280
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:29,000
好了  小姑娘们  最后再看五分钟
All right, little mamas, five-minute warning

281
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,140
-就该去刷牙了  -可是...
- till teeth brushing. - But...

282
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,400
没得讨价还价
It's not open for discussion.

283
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,510
-威廉  -威廉
- Hey, William - William!

284
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,760

Hi, everybody.

285
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:40,910
你这么晚才回来
You're home late.

286
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,300
一切还好吗
Everything okay?

287
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,770
没事  我很好
Yeah, yes. I'm fine.

288
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,700
就是忙了一天了
Just a long day.

289
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,850
我想先回床上休息了
I think I may just go lay myself down for the night.

290
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:53,330
晚安
Well... night.

291
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,430
晚安
Night.

292
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,600
好了  小鬼们  牙齿可不会自己变白哦
Okay, monsters, these teeth aren't gonna brush themselves.

293
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,930
天啊  宝贝  都吃什么了变这么沉
Oh, God. Hey, girl, what you been eating?

294
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:05,530
冰淇淋[音近"我要尖叫"]Ice cream.

295
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:08,190
你尖叫什么  我才要大叫呢
You scream? I'm gonna scream

296
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:10,640
我还得抱你俩上楼
if I got to carry you up these stairs.

297
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:13,560
你们俩太沉了
You're too heavy.

298
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:19,740
我要跟大家大声宣布的事就是
Guess the thing I really need to say out loud to everyone is,

299
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,170
我一周内成功减掉三磅了
I'm down three pounds in one week.

300
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,440
朋友们  没什么  行了  不用着...
Oh, guys, come on. Stop. Stop. You don't...

301
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:28,810
好吧好吧  你们继续吧
Well, okay, fine, keep going.

302
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,220
我  我好开心  我真的
I'm-I'm so happy. I'm...

303
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:35,280
今天工作不顺  我就去温蒂家买汉堡了
Well, I had a crap day at work, so I stopped at Wendy's.

304
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,280
{\an8}美国第三大汉堡包快餐连锁店

305
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,050
我准备在车上吃
And I was about to eat in the car,

306
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,110
要知道  我最喜欢这么干
which is... all you know is my thing.

307
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,370
可当离开汽车餐厅的那一刻
The second I left the drive-through,

308
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:47,110
我就咬牙把那十块钱的汉堡扔出车窗外了
I threw ten dollars' worth of Wendy's out of my moving car,

309
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:49,760
然后我回到家里  只吃了沙拉
and I went home, and I had a salad.

310
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,310
我知道我很可笑
I know I'm ridiculous.

311
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:55,660
在你们眼里我就是个笑话
I know I'm a joke to you guys.

312
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,840
我知道我身材走样  或者其他叫法
I know I have body distortion issues or whatever it's called,

313
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,640
但这是真的
but it's real.

314
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,390
残酷的事实
It's brutal.

315
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,970
我多想让你们看看
I wish I could show you guys

316
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,770
我自己在镜子里的样子
what I see when I look in the mirror...

317
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:09,130
省省吧
Oh, for God's sake.

318
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:12,550
麦迪逊  你才95斤
Madison, you weigh 105 pounds.

319
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,410
要是你照镜子时觉得自己是个胖妹
If you feel like a fat girl when you look in the mirror,

320
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:16,130
那怎么不上秤试试呢
why don't you step a damn scale?

321
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:18,700
看到那数字"九-十-五"
And when the scale reads "One, zero, five,"

322
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,280
你就知道自己根本不胖了
you know that you're not fat.

323
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:23,170
还有劳丽  汉堡店的事是吧
And Laurie, that Wendy's story, okay.

324
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:24,820
不好意思  但是你只是乱扔垃圾罢了
I'm sorry, but you're just a litterer.

325
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,610
你就是个该死的环境破坏者
You're just a littering damn litterer.

326
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,780
看来是时候休息一下了
Well, that feels like a good place for a break.

327
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:47,280
你在一群胖子面前变身成了绿巨人
You hulked out on a bunch of fatties.

328
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,910
一点也不好笑  托比
You're not going to make me laugh, Toby.

329
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,490
怎么了  孩子
What's up, kid?

330
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:59,030
我哥硬拉我去参加个噩梦般的好莱坞派对
My brother is making me go to this nightmare Hollywood party

331
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,490
今晚在他经纪人家里办的
at his agent's house tonight.

332
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,610
我就出去买裙子
Yeah, I went to buy a dress,

333
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,190
结果没一件合身的  一件都没有
and nothing fit, literally nothing.

334
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,850
一切都糟透了
Everything looks terrible.

335
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:06,970
我一点儿都没瘦下来
I'm not losing weight.

336
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:08,580
我快饿死了
I'm starving.

337
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:10,700
说不上来
I don't know.

338
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,770
也许就因为这事吧
That's what's up, I guess.

339
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,180
好吧
Okay.

340
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:19,070
你哥的经纪人是蕾妮·舒尔茨  对吧
Hey, your brother's agent is Lanie Shultz, right?

341
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,150
对啊
Yeah.

342
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,670
凯特  蕾妮·舒尔茨
Kate, Lanie Shultz

343
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:25,830
是我所谓的娱乐圈里
is one of the most powerful agents

344
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:28,970
最有权势的经纪人之一
in what I like to call... show business.

345
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:32,480
我听说《死侍》就是她的主意
I heard that Deadpool was her idea.

346
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,160
要不就是《汉密尔顿》
Or maybe it was Hamilton.

347
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,320
我把这两个搞混了
I get those two confused.

348
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:39,800
总之  凯特你一定要带我去那个派对
Anyway, Kate, you are so taking me to that party.

349
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,480
不行  我不想让你看到派对上的我
No. I don't want you to see me there.

350
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,340
参与这种事是我最糟糕的时刻
Like, I am at my worst at those things.

351
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:48,000
凯特  伤害一个厌食症女患者
Kate, you are at your worst

352
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,020
才是你最糟糕的时刻
when you are eviscerating the anorexic lady,

353
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,880
但我依然在你身边
and I am still standing here.

354
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:58,210
我们吃过三次午餐  四次晚餐
Look, we have had three lunches and four dinner dates.

355
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:02,130
亲热过七次  爱抚过对方两次
We have made out seven times and heavy-petted twice.

356
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:04,710
我们俩马上就要
Our plane is rapidly approaching

357
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,950
登上爱情的巨轮了
the boyfriend-girlfriend zone,

358
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:08,730
而我呢  已经准备好上船了
and, I, for one, am preparing myself for landing.

359
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:09,810
但是我希望咱俩的话题
But I need to know that everything

360
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:11,940
不要总是围绕着体重
isn't gonna always be about our weight.

361
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,760
好吗  我们得在派对上尽情狂欢
All right? We need to be able to cut loose at parties.

362
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,040
我们要精心打扮  我们还要做爱
We need to get really dressed up, we need to have sex.

363
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,200
我只是随口一说
I just slipped that in there very casually

364
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:20,320
因为我认为那是
because I think that's something

365
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,220
我们不久后就该做的事
that we should start doing very soon.

366
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:23,960
凯特  看在老天爷的份上
So, Kate, I am asking you, please,

367
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:28,530
我请求你  咱俩能抽出一天时间
for the love of God, can we spend one fat-free night

368
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:30,500
不去想肥胖的事而是参加《死侍》
at the house of the lady who came up with the idea

369
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,480
或《汉密尔顿》制片人举办的派对吗
for Deadpool and/or Hamilton?

370
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:36,770
你在笑吗
Is that a... is that a smile?

371
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:39,200
没错那是代表答应的微笑
Is that...? Yes, that's a yes and a smile.

372
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:42,300
大伙  布鲁斯·班纳[绿巨人]恢复正常了
All right, hey, guys, Bruce Banner's back.

373
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,850
没事了  绿巨人消失了
Everything's fine. The Hulk is gone.

374
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,470
大家继续吧  我向大家道个歉
Let the healing continue. Sorry about that.

375
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:54,330
你舒服吗
You comfy?

376
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:56,180
睡吧  宝贝
Okay, sweetness.

377
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,960
晚安  妈妈爱你
Good night. I love you so much.

378
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,950
我也爱你
I love you, too.

379
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,380
妈妈
Mom?

380
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,970
怎么了  宝贝
Yeah, babe?

381
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:06,840
我今天只吃了水果
I only ate fruit today.

382
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,850
你明白妈妈只是希望你健康成长吧
You know I just want you to be healthy, right?

383
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,140
妈妈也希望你开心
And I want you to be happy.

384
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:20,570
你开心吗
Are you happy?

385
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:22,890
大多数时候吧
For the most part.

386
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:27,000
那妈妈也就开心了
Well, then, I'm happy, too.

387
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,950
要不咱俩一起保持健康怎么样
Tell you what. How about you and I find a healthy balance together?

388
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,720
你觉得怎么样  不错吧
How does that sound? That sounds good?

389
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,550
好的
All right.

390
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:35,600
闭嘴
Shut up!

391
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,110
你闭嘴  "白家黑"
You shut up, Webster.

392
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,350
别给我起外号
Stop calling me names!

393
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,330
孩子们
Boys?

394
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,460
不能打架  不能打架
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

395
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:45,120
快住手  立刻回自己床上去
No, stop. To your beds right now.

396
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:46,760
赶紧
Now.

397
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,300
是谁先吵架的
Okay, who am I yelling at first?

398
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,900
小凯  你怎么了
Kev, bud, what is the deal?

399
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,730
你为什么总跟弟弟过不去
Why are you always so hard on him?

400
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,450
别人觉得我俩是兄弟很奇怪
Everybody thinks it's weird that we're brothers.

401
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,530
别人怎么想那是他们的事
You know it doesn't matter what people think.

402
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:05,200
他是你的弟弟  凯文
He is your little brother, Kevin.

403
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,280
你们一定要互相照应
You have to be there for one another.

404
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,950
你听懂了吗
Do you hear me?

405
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,590
懂了
Yes.

406
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,440
我爱你
I love you.

407
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,390
你能让他对我好点吗
Can you force him be nice?

408
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,750
我会尽力的
I'll see what I can do.

409
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:33,250
答应我  你要当个听话的乖孩子
Promise me you'll always be good.

410
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,600
我也会尽力的
I'll see what I can do, too.

411
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,740
我爱你
I love you.

412
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,690
赶紧睡觉吧  孩子们
Now get some sleep, please.

413
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,000
不许再吵架了
No more fighting.

414
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,030
别让我再发现你们闹别扭
Don't make me come back in here.

415
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,550
晚安  我爱你们
Good night, I love you.

416
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,320
亲爱的
Hi, baby.

417
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,960
亲爱的
Hi, baby.

418
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,820
我错过哄他们睡觉了吗
Did I miss putting them down?

419
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,420
也就晚了一小时
Just by an hour.

420
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,080
我刚才...
Well, I was...

421
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:22,970
刚才在买东西
I was-- oh, shopping.

422
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,940
我在买东西
I was shopping.

423
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,930
我知道
I know...

424
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:35,680
我们最近产生了一些分歧
I know we haven't been on the same page lately.

425
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:39,890
但我们得回到正轨上来  宝贝
That we just got to get back on track, baby.

426
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:41,070
所以
So...

427
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,100
就当这是...
consider this a...

428
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,440
一份贵重的谢罪礼吧
way-too-expensive peace offering.

429
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,680
我们已经不止是偏离正轨了
I think we've been more than off track.

430
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,710
你觉得我们目前为止做得怎么样
Hey, how do you think we're doing so far?

431
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,220
当父母这方面
At parenting?

432
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,670
-我...  -我觉得我们也就六分
- I... - 'Cause I think we're at a six.

433
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,670
平心而论  从一到十
On a sliding scale, one through ten,

434
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,960
我觉得打六分都算很大方了
I think we're at a six and I think I'm being generous.

435
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,980
-小贝  -那就七分
- Bec... - Seven, fine,

436
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,890
但那只是因为我们有三个孩子
but only because there are three of them.

437
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,550
-宝贝...  -问题是
- Baby, I... - And the thing is,

438
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,060
我拼命想达到九分的标准
I'm trying really hard to get us to a nine.

439
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,500
因为这些可爱的孩子值得九分的父母
Because they are cute kids, and they deserve nine-parents.

440
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:29,410
但我觉得  只有我在努力  杰克
And, the thing is, I feel like I'm there, Jack.

441
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:33,470
只有我在以九分的标准照顾他们
I feel like I'm operating at a nine.

442
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:38,780
因为我给他们每人准备
Because I do individualized lunches

443
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,480
不同的午餐  挨个哄他们睡觉
and I do individualized tuck-ins for each kid

444
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,130
这样没人会不开心
so nobody feels gypped.

445
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:44,360
而且
And...

446
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,770
当你回到家  做自己的时候
When you're home, and you're you,

447
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:55,130
比我强太多了
you're way better than I am.

448
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:59,340
当你做自己时你是十分  杰克
You're a ten when you're you, Jack.

449
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,880
但你回家越来越晚
But you're getting home later and later

450
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,940
当你好不容易回了家以后  你...
and when you do come home, you're...

451
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:05,740
小贝  你在说什么
Bec, what are you saying?

452
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,530
你不能再这样喝酒了
The drinking has to stop.

453
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,120
你必须克服它  宝贝
You have to reign it in, baby,

454
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,250
因为我决不允许我家有人酗酒
because I won't have it in my house.

455
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,410
-你不允许你家...  -不允许
- You won't have it in your house. - I won't.

456
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:21,380
如果这是个问题  解决它
So if it's a problem, fix it.

457
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,400
成熟点  解决它
Be a man, and fix it.

458
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,590
我不能再让你拉低我们的分数了
Because I'm done letting you lower our score.

459
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:43,460
不是吧
Damn.

460
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,640
-还行吧  -是啊
- Yeah? - Yeah.

461
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,810
太行了
Hell to the yeah.

462
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:48,780
谢谢
Thanks.

463
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:50,280
你穿得挺有型的
You look dapper.

464
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:51,740
混娱乐圈嘛
Ah, show business.

465
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,440
太好了  到齐了
Oh, great, you're, uh--

466
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,510
我们该走了
We got to go, you know?

467
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:55,910
-我们要迟到了  -好
- 'Cause we're gonna be late. - Okay.

468
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:57,530
你就穿这身吗
You're wearing that?

469
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:58,570
对
Yeah.

470
00:21:58,570 --> 00:21:59,580
真不错
That's great.

471
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:03,070
-你看上去棒极了  -帽子太骚了吗
- You look awesome. - Oh, is the hat too much?

472
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,350
帽子才是精华
The hat is everything.

473
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,950
是啊  那可是真正的孔雀毛
Yeah, that's a real peacock feather.

474
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:09,110
走吧  娱乐圈我来了
Come on, show business!

475

476
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:21,930
好吗
Okay?

477
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,850
-奶爸不干了  -给他们点颜色瞧瞧
- Manny out. - Go get 'em.

478
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:31,100
咱们俩会惊艳全场的
You and I are crushing that dance floor.

479
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,600
我们走  来吧
Let's go. Come on, let's go.

00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,490
天啊
Oh, no!

483
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,640
来呀  跳起来
Come on! Come on.

484
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:08,350
凯特
Kate.

485
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:10,010
凯特
Kate.

486
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:11,200
凯特
Kate.

487
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,910
好吧  咱们走  喝点酒去
All right, come on, come on, we're getting you drunk.

488
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:18,300
-来  我们喝酒去  -我们走了吧
- Come on, yup. Time to get drunk. - Let's just go.

489
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:20,590
杰克
Jack,

490
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:21,480
我是米格尔
It's Miguel.

491
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,170
已经很晚了  但又怕明早见不着你
It's late, so I'm leaving you a message at the office

492
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:25,560
所以就给你办公室留了条言
in case I miss you in the morning.

493
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,630
我之前好像越界了
Feel like I overstepped before.

494
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:32,150
你知道我爱你
Um, you know I love you,

495
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,540
我也爱你们一家人
you know I love you guys.

496
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:34,880
怎么说...
Hell...

497
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,310
或者说我只是嫉妒你们俩
I'm jealous of your relationship, if anything.

498
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,800
之前在酒吧我不该说那些的
Uh, I shouldn't have said anything at the bar.

499
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,090
我好像又说过火了
Now I'm just overdoing it.

500
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,720
就这些  再见
Okay. Bye.

501
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:50,740
{\an7}外科病理学最新进展
胃癌

502
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:55,330
你该去睡觉了  很晚了
You need to get some sleep, it's late.

503
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,260
你早上差不多四点就起床了
You've been up since, like, 4:00 this morning.

504
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,200
我知道
No, I know.

505
00:23:58,290 --> 00:23:59,390
还有五分钟
Just five more minutes.

506
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:07,040
去洗澡
Shower.

507
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:08,090
然后睡觉
Sleep.

508
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,260
赶紧去
Now.

509
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:11,960
如果你洗得够快
You shower quick,

510
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,470
最后这五分钟还可以换种方式运动
you can work off that last five minutes a different way.

511
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:24,840
我很高兴咱们能聚在一起
I am so happy that we could all get together.

512
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,900
解决一些问题...
You know, work through, and...

513
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,130
凯文只是心情不太好
and... Kevin just feels awful...

514
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:31,930
蕾妮  虽然很抱歉  但这一切荒谬至极
I'm so sorry, this is whole thing, Lanie, is ridiculous.

515
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,150
我是说
I mean...

516
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,030
曼宁先生
Mr. Manning.

517
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:39,120
我真心感激你的电视网
I'm truly grateful for everything

518
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,190
为我所做的一切  真的
that your network has done for me, I am.

519
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:44,430
但请允许我任性一次  先生
But please let me go with God, sir.

520
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:46,690
我之前处理问题的方式
The way I handled myself,

521
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:49,270
确实不太对  我第一个站出来承认
I mean, that was wrong, I'll be the first one to admit that.

522
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,480
我确实做错了
That-that was wrong.

523
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:54,980
但我们能不能抛开前嫌...
But can't we all, at this point, just, sort of, you know...

524
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,600
向前看  好吗
sort of move on, right?

525
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,320
你是个好孩子  凯文
You're a good kid, Kevin.

526
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,360
我很欣赏你的诚实
I appreciate your honesty.

527
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,260
谢谢
Thank you.

528
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,820
这部剧收视率不错
The show, it's a solid performer,

529
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,140
但不是我们电视网最重要的节目
but it's not the biggest thing on my network.

530
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,320
如果不是蕾妮向我推荐你
Without Lanie telling me,

531
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,600
我会从这些端餐盘的服务员里
would I have known you from one of these waiters

532
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,690
认识你这个无名小卒吗
passing around the chicken skewers?

533
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:20,580
-应该不会吧  -是吗
- Probably not. - Really?

534
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:23,440
我并不关心我的三流喜剧幕后
I really don't care what happens behind the scenes

535
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,440
发生了些什么
on my third-rated sitcom.

536
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,010
你知道我关心什么吗
You know what I do care about?

537
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,940
圣马丁  凯文
St. Maarten, Kevin.

538
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:34,150
我要在圣马丁建一个家
I'm building a home in St. Maarten

539
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:37,460
不出两年我就要退休了
and in two years I'm going to retire,

540
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:40,830
然后我会和我的爱妻搬去那里
and my favorite wife and I are going to move there.

541
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,620
在那之前
Until then,

542
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:46,090
我只想安稳度过这两年
I plan on just drifting through these two years

543
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:50,010
尽可能地避免痛苦和波折
as painlessly and drama-free as possible.

544
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:51,820
就像服用吗啡一样  凯文
Like I'm on morphine, Kevin,

545
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:55,140
我就想这么度过这两年
that's how I'll be drifting through those years.

546
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,480
好吧
Okay.

547
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:05,150
这主意很棒
That's... great, you know?

548
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:06,750
随心所欲
Go with God.

549
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:11,820
问题是...  借过一下  亲爱的
You know, the thing is-- excuse me darling.

550
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:16,870
给热门情景喜剧换个新男主
Recasting the lead on a hit sitcom,

551
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:22,090
就不是服用吗啡了  你说呢  凯文
isn't exactly drifting on morphine, now is it, Kevin?

552
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:24,740
所以很遗憾  孩子
So unfortunately, my boy,

553
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,930
你必须继续演这部剧
you're not gonna be leaving the show.

554
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:32,360
如果你不演  我只能毁了你的生活和事业
If you do, I'll be forced to Nagasaki your life and career.

555
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:36,490
你听说过一个叫泰勒·詹宁斯的演员吗
Hey, have you ever heard of the actor, uh, Taylor Jennings?

556
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:38,330
没听说过
I'm not familiar with the name.

557
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,610
我毁了他
I Nagasaki'd him.

558
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:43,740
孩子  好好拿钱
So take the money, kid.

559
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:46,940
未来几年安心演戏
Ride out the next couple years, all right?

560
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:50,460
否则  我会让你成为比现在
Otherwise, I'll make you a bigger laughingstock

561
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,660
更大的笑柄
than you already are.

562
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:55,290
成交
Deal?

563
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,760
抱歉  我要去...
I'm sorry, I'm j...I'm gonna go, uh...

564
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:00,300
找我的妹妹
my sister's here.

565
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,780
我得去看一下她
I'm gonna go check on her.

566
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:06,540
是他的双胞胎妹妹
It's his twin sister.

567
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,240
一个胖姑娘
Big girl.

568
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,850
-你喜欢喝醉的凯特  -我喜欢喝醉的凯特
- You love drunk Kate. - I love drunk Kate.

569
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:20,070
等一下  什么
Wait, what?

570
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,840
进展怎么样  我喝得烂醉
How'd it go? I'm wasted.

571
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,710
不太好
Not good.

572
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,700
好  天啊  太好了
Good? Oh, my God, that's great.

573
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,060
不不不  是"不好"
No, no, no, no, not good.

574
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,950
我不知道我该怎么做
It did not...I don't know what I'm gonna do.

575
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,180
-我在钓鱼  -你钓了一条大鱼
- Gone fishing. - You caught a whopper!

576
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:39,280
快收线   把我收上去
Come reel me in, got to reel me in.

577
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,280
这是我第一次钓鱼
It's my first time fishing.

578
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:43,780
-还会有下次  -好吧
- Won't be his last. - Well...

579
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:56,150
哪只小怪兽站在我门口
Which little monster's standing at my door?

580
00:27:57,770 --> 00:28:00,800
没关系  我年纪大了  怪兽都吓不到我了
It's okay, I'm way too old to be scared of monsters.

581
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:07,100
我想我们该谈谈了
I think it's time you and I had a talk.

582
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,270
{\an8}兰德尔

583
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:43,120
我已经想上课想疯了
I can't wait until the next day of school starts.

584
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:45,120
大家快看  是"白家黑"
Hey, everyone, it's Webster!

585
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:52,010
小凯
Kev,

586
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,650
过来  凯文  别管"白家黑"了
come on, Kevin, ditch Webster.

587
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:54,530
我们走
Let's go.

588
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:56,060
快过来
Come on.

589
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,070
现在给你打电话  是不是太晚了
Hey, uh... is it too late out there?

590
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,760
我记得你经常熬夜
I know you're usually up late, right?

591
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:15,390
不晚  我刚刚...
No, I was just, uh...

592
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:17,490
在赶几份文件
catching up on some paperwork.

593
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:19,010
太好了
Good, uh...

594
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,010
我知道  发生那些事情之后
Hey, listen, I-I know I've owed you a phone call

595
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:21,710
我应该给你打个电话
since everything went down,

596
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:23,830
但因为实在太离谱了
it's been crazy out here, just... you know.

597
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,250
没关系
No, it's all good.

598
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,050
凯特都告诉我了
Kate's kept me up to speed.

599
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:28,150
很好
Good.

600
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:37,740
他们说决不会让我离开剧组
They said they're not gonna let me out of the show, man.

601
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,800
而我...
And I...

602
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,470
我不知道要怎么做
I don't know what I'm gonna do, like...

603
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:43,630
他们还要牵制我两年  甚至更久
they locked me in for two more years, maybe more.

604
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:44,960
真糟
Damn.

605
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:47,530
那你打算怎么做
Well, what are you gonna do?

606
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,280
我倒是希望你能告诉我
I was kind of hoping you'd tell me.

607
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,420
因为你在乎我的想法吗
Oh, because you care what I think?

608
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:55,250
因为我在乎所有人的想法
Because I care what everyone thinks, man.

609
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,170
你知道的
You know that.

610
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,400
对你来说  我不是个好哥哥  是吗
I was not a very good brother to you, was I?

611
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:05,140
对  你不是
No, you weren't.

612
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,690
但你还有时间弥补
But you've still got time.

613
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:12,780
没错
Yeah, uh...

614
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:16,020
总之  时间不早了
Anyway, look, it's getting late, man, I, you know...

615
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,010
我该挂电话了
I probably should go.

616
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,030
那个...
It's, uh...

617
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:19,900
凯特在这呢  我在跟兰德尔打电话
Kate's here, it's Randall.

618
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:22,430
-好啊  兰德尔  -你好
- Oh, hey, Randall! - Hey.

619
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:24,170
总之吧  或许我应该...
Anyway, yeah, I-I should probably, uh...

620
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:26,270
回去把自己卖给电视网
I got to go back inside and sell my soul to the network,

621
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:27,530
就像妓女那样
like the whore that I am.

622
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,620
小凯
Hey, Kev.

623
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:33,600
深呼吸  好吗
Deep breath, okay?

624
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,850
来吧  兄弟  第一个...
Come on, man. First came...

625
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:41,930
是我
Me.

626
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:42,980
爸爸说...
And Dad said...

627
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,360
"天哪"
"Gee."

628
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:49,820
-然后是...  -是我
-And then came... - Me!

629
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:50,970
妈妈说...
And Mom said...

630
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:52,370
"妈呀"  接下来是...
"Whee!" And then came...

631
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:53,890
是我  然后他们说
Me. And they said...

632
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:54,890
"三个了"
"That's three."

633
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:57,030
-三个小家伙  -三个小家伙
- Big Three! - Big Three!

634
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:07,630
好点了吗
You good?

635
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:11,180
我很好  我很好
Yeah, I'm good, I'm good.

636
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,670
-凯文  -怎么
- Kevin? - Yeah?

637
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:18,530
爸妈可没养过什么妓女
Mom and Dad didn't raise no whores.

638
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:22,480
除了凯特画眼线搞叛逆那段时间
Except briefly, during Kate's eyeliner phase.

639
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:25,920
是啊
Yeah.

640
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:31,240
晚安  小弟
Night, little brother.

641
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:34,500
晚安  大哥
Night, big brother.

642
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:44,750
亲爱的
Hon?

643
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:46,790
-给你  -谢谢
- There you go. - Thank you.

644
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:51,270
我就开门见山吧
Can I cut to the chase?

645
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:53,480
你说了算
It's your meeting.

646
00:31:57,350 --> 00:32:00,600
八年前  我第一次怀孕
Eight years ago, I was, um, pregnant for the first time.

647
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:04,090
当时兰德尔在竞争公司合伙人的职位
And Randall was vying for partner at his firm.

648
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,800
我们毫不犹豫买了这幢房子
We'd just bought this house on faith,

649
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:09,860
虽然有好多地方要装修
even though it needed a lot of work,

650
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:13,150
虽然我们根本买不起
even though we couldn't afford it whatsoever.

651
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:16,150
后来兰德尔成了合伙人
Then Randall made partner.

652
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,920
房子的所有活都是他自己干的
He did all the work on the house himself,

653
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,560
所以我们没花一分钱
so we didn't have to spend a penny.

654
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:23,150
而且在我怀孕期间
And he made sure I didn't lift a finger

655
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:24,840
他一丁点事都没让我做
during my pregnancy.

656
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,330
他是个好男人
He's a good man.

657
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:27,460
不  不是好
No, he's not good.

658
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:29,720
是完美
He's perfect.

659
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:33,300
可问题是  他失眠了
Problem is, he stopped sleeping.

660
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,180
有一天早上  我在卫生间
And then one morning, I was in the bathroom,

661
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:40,160
他大声喊我
and he called out to me.

662
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,600
他懵了  你懂吗
And he was confused, you know?

663
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:46,090
他懵了  因为他...
He was confused because he...

664
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:48,650
什么都看不见了
couldn't see anything.

665
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:55,350
我的丈夫  我的靠山
My husband-- my mountain of a man--

666
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:59,580
他的眼睛什么都看不见了
could literally no longer see things through his eyes.

667
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:03,440
就好像当了28年的完美之人
It was as if 28 years of being that perfect

668
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,440
在那天早上突然就把他击垮了
had all caught up to him that morning.

669
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:09,060
后来他...
And he, um...

670
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:11,610
他解决了那个问题
he pulled himself out of it.

671
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,740
他自己治好了眼睛
He self-corrected,

672
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:18,790
因为我丈夫就是这样的人
'cause that's what my man does.

673
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,570
兰德尔并不是没有缺点  威廉
Randall is not free of vice, William.

674
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:29,230
他的缺点就是他的善良
His vice is his goodness.

675
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:33,240
他强迫自己必须完美
It's his compulsive drive to be perfect.

676
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,460
所以我才爱他...
It's why I love him...

677
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:42,000
也正因为如此有时我得保护他
but it's also why I have to protect him sometimes, you know?

678
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:46,150
所以  我得问你几个问题
So now, I'm gonna have to ask you a couple questions,

679
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:51,980
问几个他问不出口的问题
questions he would probably be too polite to ask himself.

680
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,550
尽管问
Ask away.

681
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:57,480
你借的钱
The money you borrow.

682
00:33:58,670 --> 00:33:59,990
你用来坐车了吗
You use it for the bus?

683
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:02,070
是的
Yes.

684
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:05,230
你去哪了
Where do you go?

685
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:08,080
你每天都在外面待很久
You're gone all day, every day.

686
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,580
我家在费城  要坐很久的车
My place in Philadelphia, it's a long ride.

687
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:14,780
为什么
Why?

688
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:16,670
你还在吸毒吗
Are you using drugs?

689
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:18,660
-你去买毒品吗  -不是
- Are you getting drugs? - No.

690
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,040
你真的生病了吗
Are you really sick?

691
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,110
真的
Yes, I am.

692
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:29,590
贝丝  我之前就说过  而且我是真心的
Beth, I said it before, and I really meant it,

693
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,340
如果你们嫌我待太久了
if I'm overstaying my welcome,

694
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,960
我希望你们能直接告诉我
I wish you would just say it.

695
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,260
威廉  你待得太久...
William, you are overstaying...

696
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,080
贝丝
Beth.

697
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:41,810
你们在干什么
What are you doing?

698
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:42,980
总得有人
Somebody has to

699
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,840
-把事问清楚  宝贝...  -是因为猫
- ask the questions here, baby... - It's a cat.

700
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:47,960
我有只猫
I have a cat.

701
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,750
它是我的唯一了
It's all I really have.

702
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:54,750
它叫克鲁尼
His name's Clooney.

703
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:58,180
挺讽刺的名字  因为它很丑
One of those ironic names, 'cause he's a pretty ugly cat.

704
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,270
我来回跑是为了喂它
I go back and forth to feed him.

705
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,330
每天坐三个小时大巴
Three hours on the bus each day.

706
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,870
你为什么不直接跟我们说你有只猫
Why wouldn't you just tell us you had a cat?

707
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,980
你们小女儿有哮喘
The little one has asthma

708
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,670
我知道如果我说了猫的事
and I knew if I brought up the cat,

709
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:12,770
你们会让我带它来
you'd tell me to bring it,

710
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:14,030
这样就会添麻烦
that would cause problems.

711
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,700
但我不想给你们添麻烦
And I don't want to cause any problems,

712
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:17,290
因为添了麻烦我就得走
'cause if I cause problems, I'd have to leave.

713
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:17,880
但...
And...

714
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,240
但我不想走
and I don't want to leave.

715
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,710
六个月前  医生告诉我还有三个月时间
Six months ago, some doctor told me I had three to live.

716
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:27,520
但不知怎么的  最近我没那么难受了
But for some reason, I don't feel so bad lately.

717
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:30,020
也许是因为这个家
Maybe to do with this house.

718
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:31,810
我不知道
I don't know.

719
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,600
说实话  我从未想过
Truth is, I'd never thought

720
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,310
我的生命中  除了那只丑猫
I'd have anything to care about again

721
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:38,200
还会有其他值得在乎的东西  所以...
besides an ugly cat, so...

722
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:45,090
我感觉自己现在很贱
Well, now I feel like a bitch.

723
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:49,250
不好笑
It's not funny.

724
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:50,190
不好笑
It's not.

725
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,010
不好笑
It's not funny.

726
00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:01,960
还有两小时我就要把胃呕出来了
I'm about two hours away from throwing up violently.

727
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,670
你能帮我扶着头发吗  托比
Are you gonna hold my hair for me, Toby?

728
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:07,690
不  我要待在这里
No. I-I'm still gonna be at this party,

729
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:09,430
看能不能钓到一个吉尔莫女孩
trying to bang a Gilmore Girl.

730
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:13,140
祝你成功
Well, go for both.

731
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:15,170
多一个吉尔莫  多一分快乐
Gil-more the Gil-merrier.

732
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:25,080
我的生活总是围绕着体重  托比
It's always gonna be about the weight for me, Toby.

733
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,440
我小时候就是这样了
It's been my story ever since I was a little girl.

734
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,970
每当我试着不去想
And every moment that I'm not thinking about it,

735
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:37,020
我还是会想
I'm thinking about it.

736
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:39,270
比如
Like...

737
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:40,940
这椅子我不会坐垮吧
Will this chair hold me?

738
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,640
这衣服我能穿进去吗
Will this dress fit me?

739
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:47,450
如果哪天我怀孕了
And if I ever get pregnant, would...

740
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:49,070
会有人看出来吗
will anyone ever notice?

741
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:57,180
这就是我生活的重心  无法改变
It's just at the core of who I am, it's just deep inside,

742
00:36:57,190 --> 00:37:00,170
八杯龙舌兰下肚也只能自欺欺人几小时
and eight tequila shots can only mask that for a couple hours.

743
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:01,780
-所以...  -我懂
- So... - I know.

744
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,540
其实你喝了十杯
And it was ten tequila shots,

745
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,120
但我懂  我理解
but I... I get it. I know.

746
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:13,300
再说一句
And just for the record,

747
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:18,890
这身衣服真的很配你
this dress is fitting you in all the right places.

748
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,250
这身旧衣服
This old thing?

749
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,550
我就随便穿的
I mean, I-I just threw it on.

750
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:24,670
你随便穿的
Oh, you just threw it on?

751
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:26,190
我想都没多想
I didn't even think about it.

752
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:32,940
他来了
There he is.

753
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:37,890
我让他们滚蛋了
I told 'em to go screw themselves.

754
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:39,460
他们怎么说
And what'd they say?

755
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:43,240
很多尖酸又刻薄的话
A lot of mean, scary things.

756
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,270
我要去演戏剧
I'm gonna do theater. You know?

757
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:55,790
我要搬到纽约去
I'm moving to New York.

758
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:01,590
娱乐圈啊
Show business.

759
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:14,830
你怎么在这里
What are you doing out here?

760
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,680
我不想睡得离你太远
I don't like sleeping far away from you.

761
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,550
我再也不喝酒了
No more drinking.

762
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:27,050
这不是说戒就...
You can't just stop...

763
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,040
我能
I can.

764
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,170
为了你  我能戒
For you, I can.

765
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:32,770
我会戒
I will.

766
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,710
我小的时候
You know, when I was a little boy,

767
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:42,540
我不知道长大后要成为什么样的人
I didn't know what I wanted to be when I grew up.

768
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:51,120
而大人们总会问孩子这种问题
Adults always ask little kids that.

769
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:56,940
我从没想出一个好答案
You know? I never had a good answer.

770
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:00,590
直到我28岁那年
Not until... not until I was 28.

771
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,750
直到我遇到了你
Till the day that I met you.

772
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:10,620
我才确信自己想成为什么样的人
That's when I knew exactly what I wanted to be when I grew up,

773
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:14,920
我想成为让你幸福的男人
I wanted to be the man that made you happy.

774
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,540
你让我很幸福
You make me happy.

775
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:22,280
不总是那样
Not always.

776
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:25,320
最近就没有
Not lately.

777
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:33,900
从今以后  我要为你做到11分  亲爱的
From here on out, I'm gonna be an 11 for you, baby.

778
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:37,630
不
No...

779
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,730
豁出去了
Screw that.

780
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:45,340
从现在开始  我要做12分的好丈夫
I'm gonna be a 12 for you, from here out.

781
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:48,030
11分给孩子们
I'll be an 11 for the kids,

782
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,500
12分给你
but you get a 12.

783
00:39:57,090 --> 00:39:58,170
你能原谅我吗
Do you forgive me?

784
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:04,530
你像只拉布拉多犬一样睡在门外
You slept outside our bedroom door like a Labrador.

785
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:08,200
我当然原谅你了
Of course I forgive you.

786
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:17,020
我还能送你礼物吗
Can I still give you my gift?

787
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,820
如果你非要送的话
If you insist.

788
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:33,980
喜欢吗
Do you like it?

789
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,300
-我买了月亮是因为  -我们的专属之歌
- I got a moon because of... - Our song.

790
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,130
对
Yeah.

791
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,400
我一辈子都不会摘下来
I'm never gonna take it off.

792
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:51,240
喜欢吗
Do you like it?

793
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,500
好看吗
Does it look good?

794
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:55,630
非常好看
It's beautiful.

795
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,210
谢谢
Thank you.

796
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,210
孩子还有多久会醒
How much time we have till the kids get up?

797
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:08,680
我才不管孩子呢
I don't care about the kids.

798
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:15,650
叠罗汉
Pile drive!

799
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:42,890
爸爸  不要  爸爸  别闹了
Daddy, stop! Daddy, stop!

800

00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:39,760
你觉得你能联系上那个特别可爱的
Do you think you could get that really cute, uh,

136
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,220
特别喜欢我的
that theater casting director,

137
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,380
-舞台剧星探吗  她叫...-卡拉
- the one who liked me. What's... - Cara.

138
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:45,300
卡拉  没错  我爱卡拉
Cara, yes. I love Cara... Yeah.

139
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:46,180
等你打通了她的电话
and when you get her on the phone,

140
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,460
记得告诉她  我只对正剧感兴趣
tell her I'm only interested in doing heavy drama.

141
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,830
我们一路折腾到纽约
We're not moving all the way to New York City

142
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:52,350
不是为了演一些非百老汇的垃圾喜剧
so I can do some lame off-Broadway comedy.

143
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,720
你想让我跟你一起去吗
You want me to go with you?

144
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:55,560
当然
Of course. Yeah.

145
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,910
没有你我什么事情都做不了
There's no way I could do this without you.

146
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,480
也许你还得跟他们明确
and maybe you should specify that I don't want to

147
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,260
我不想做任何需要展示我的鸡巴的事
do anything where I have to show my penis.

148
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:04,530
托比
Toby.

149
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:05,900
我不知道你也在这  老兄  怎么了
I didn't see you there, man. What's up?

150
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,620
这个好吃吗  你知道我们要做什么吗
How's this? You know what we should do?

151
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,100
我们应该去曼哈顿肉库区看看
We should look into the Meatpacking District.

152
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,390
前途无量啊
It's like an up and coming.

153
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,020
煎饼很不错
Pancakes are good.

154
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,700
她逼你吃这种东西吗
Is she making you eat this?

155
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,870
我在争取和她上床
I'm trying to have some sex.

156
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:22,570
他来家里快一周了
So now he's been here for about a week.

157
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:26,830
我想试着去习惯他这个人的存在
I guess I just wanted to get used to the idea of him myself,

158
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,190
之后再把这事告诉你们
you know, before I told you,

159
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,050
但这与你和爸爸没有任何关系
and this has nothing to do with you or Dad--

160
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:31,550
我希望你能理解
I hope you know that.

161
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,930
我能理解  我当然理解  好了
I do know that, yes, of course. ?Okay, okay.

162
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,470
很显然  我从很小的时候
I mean, obviously, I've been curious about him

163
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:36,560
就对他感到好奇
since I was a kid.

164
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:41,050
我知道你们如果能找的话早就找到他了
And I know you guys would have found him if you could have.

165
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:45,620
那么他是谁
So who is he?

166
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,580
他的身世和你说过多少
What did he tell you about himself?

167
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,440
他叫威廉
His name is William.

168
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:53,000
只有名字吗
That's it?

169
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,530
他没告诉你别的事吗
He didn't tell you anything else? ?

170
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,220
他养了一只猫
He has a cat.

171
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:58,760
他得了胃癌
Stomach cancer.

172
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:03,180
目前为止我只知道这些
It's the basic gist of what I know so far.

173
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,320
他在哪呢
Well, where is he?

174
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,860
我想见见他
I'd like to, uh, meet him.

175
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,490
-他在安妮的房间  可是...  -好的
- He's in Annie's room, but... - ?Okay.

176
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,920
我不知道他是否准备好见客人  妈妈
I don't know if he's ready for company, Ma.

177
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,270
等一下
Hold on one second.

178
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,270
好了
Okay.

179
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,010
汽车座椅安好了
Car seats are installed.

180
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,210
警察批准了
Policeman approved.

181
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:38,980
我把车开过来  然后上车
I'll pull up, we'll load up.

182
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:40,970
我们的冒险从此就开始了  好吗
And then the adventure begins, yeah?

183
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:42,430
好的
Okay.

184
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,940
我要是你就头也不回地去墨西哥
If I were you, I would head right to Mexico.

185
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,240
要是我没回来  你至少知道去哪找我
If I don't come back, at least you'll know where to find me.

186
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,560
等等
Wait.

187
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,030

你气色不错

199
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,080
{\an8}我们的生活
第一季  第三集

200
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:16,590
别害怕  我的小美女
It's okay, my little lady.

201
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,340
他不喝我的奶
He's not taking my breast.

202
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,990
我们把她翻过来  然后裹住她
We just go put her over and wreathe her.

203
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:28,250
帮帮我吧  他太难哄了
Can you help with him, please? He's being really fussy.

204
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,800
家里有围嘴  去他们的卧室找找
We have burping cloths. Look in their bedroom.

205
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,380
没找到  不在这
It's not... there's not... in here.

206
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,330
你快回来吧
Please, just come back in here.

207
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:36,670
-快来帮帮我  -好的
- I need you to help me, please. - Okay.

208
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,220
你躺下了吗  杰克
Are you laying down, Jack? ?

209
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:40,330
你去看看凯文好吗
Can you please check on Kevin?

210
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,930
为什么  他为什么哭个不停
Why, why won't he stop crying?

211
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,090
他们一转眼就上大学了
They'll be in college soon.

212
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:53,670
是哪个
?Which one?

213
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,030
大概是讨厌我的那个吧
Probably the one that hates me.

214
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,990
-他不讨厌你  -杰克
- He doesn't hate you. - Jack,

215
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,280
我想我们得开始喂他奶粉了
I think we're gonna have to start him on formula.

216
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,280
不用  他很好
No. He's fine.

217
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:03,980
他不喝我的奶
He won't take to my breast.

218
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,550
我们得用相同的方式对待他们
We have to treat them the same.

219
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,750
可他并不相同
He's not the same.

220
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:08,900
对不起  对不起
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

221
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:09,830
他不一样
He's just... He's not.

222
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,380
另外两个孩子是在我肚子里长大的
I grew the other two  inside of me,

223
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,870
可他却像个外人
and he feels like a stranger.

224
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:16,250
虽然这么说我真的很难过
And I feel really terrible for saying that out loud,

225
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,630
可我真的这么认为
but he just... he does.

226
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,040
杰克
Jack,

227
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,620
我们离开医院的时候
when we were leaving the hospital...

228
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,920
我知道  你考虑过不带他回家
I know. You were having second thoughts about bringing him home.

229
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,740
没关系的
It's fine.

230
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,780
-不  不是这样的  -这很正常
- No. No, it's not that. I...  - It's natural.

231
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,500
他没问题  小贝
He's fine, Bec.

232
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:42,920
他没问题的
He's fine.

233
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:46,890
你看我们俩
Look at us.

234
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:51,450
我以前也就是个陌生人
I mean, I was a complete stranger.

235
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,430
但你的胸不也很快被我攻下了
Look how quickly I took to your breast.

236
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,620
你就是个笨蛋
You're an idiot. ?

237
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,100
对啊  我是你的小笨蛋
Yeah. I'm your idiot.

238
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,100
行了吧
Okay?

239
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:01,040
他们是我们的孩子
And they are our babies.

240
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,660
他也是我们的孩子
He's our baby.

241
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:06,720
好吗
Okay?

242
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,010
他们很快就去上大学了吧
They'll be in college soon?

243
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,960
指日可待
Any day now.

244
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,610
然后她就说要和他单独谈谈了
And then she just asked to speak to him alone.

245
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,890
-谈什么呢  -我不知道
- About what? - I don't know.

246
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:24,340
就亲生父亲和养母该谈的事吧
Whatever biological fathers and adopted mothers talk about.

247
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,380
{\an8}NBA尼克斯队命名由来

248
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,380
-那是什么  -尼克斯旧货商什么的
- What is that? - The Knicks,

249
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,990
贝丝  我怎么会知道他们在谈什么
Beth. How the hell am I supposed to know?

250
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,740
我...
I...

251
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:34,670
你这么爱我  你一定会给我亲亲的
You love me so much that you're just gonna give me that one?

252
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,390
你真了解我  朋友
You know me so well, my friend.

253
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:42,990
再过两小时我还要带他去看医生
I got to take him to that doctor's appointment in two hours.

254
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:46,010
天啊  你觉得
God. What the hell do you think

255
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:48,180
-他们究竟谈什么  -我不知道  亲爱的
- they're talking about, anyway? - I don't know, honey.

256
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,380
是他找到我的
He found me.

257
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:53,000
-他带我来这儿  -但是你在这儿住了
- He brought me here. - But you stayed.

258
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,360
是的  我住下了
Yes, I stayed. ?

259
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:56,490
我们之前约定好的
We had a deal.

260
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:00,270
我不会告诉他的  如果你担心这个的话
I won't tell him, if that's what you're thinking.

261
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,530
天啊  那一切...
Oh, God. All those...

262
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:08,830
会让他崩溃的
It will break him.

263
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:12,620
绝对会  要是他知道他本可以认识你
It will. Knowing that he could've known you

264
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:14,340
却被我横中阻拦了
and that I kept him from that.

265
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,800
丽贝卡  我们的约定是明智之举
Rebecca, the deal we made was the right one.

266
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:18,830
对每个人都好
For everyone.

267
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,330
-如果你敢伤害他...  -我不会的 
- If you hurt him... - ?I won't.

268
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:27,950
那就好
Fine, then.

269
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,300
不过你记住
But know this

270
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:34,990
我儿子
my son,

271
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,080
我抚养成人的他
who I raised,

272
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:42,790
肯定会竭尽全力来救你
is gonna put everything he has into trying to save you,

273
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,840
因为这就是他的为人
because that's who he is.

274
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,480
他会把这事看得比工作还重要
It's gonna come in front of his job,

275
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:49,330
也比婚姻更重要
in front of his marriage,

276
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,210
甚至比他在家陪孩子还重要
and in front of his time with his kids.

277
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,870
所以你最好不要辜负他
So you better damn well be worth that.

278
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,320
该死的
Damn it.

279
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,460
该死的
Damn it.

280
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,280
是  在我们帮他租到房子之前
Yes, um, it would be for an open-ended reservation,

281
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,950
都要无限期地预订这房间
until we can find him a rental.

282
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:22,350
你们那儿的枕头不会过敏吧
And your pillows are hypoallergenic, yeah?

283
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:27,120
还有我想确认下酒店的健身房
And can I just confirm that the hotel gym's not just, like,

284
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,770
该不会只有三台旧跑步机吧
three crappy elliptical machines?

285
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,750
因为他需要场地做俯卧撑之类的锻炼
'Cause he needs space for floor work and exercise

286
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,410
-还有力量训练...  -很好
- and free weight... - Great.

287
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:35,630
或者  你方便发几张照片给我看下吗
You know, actually, can I just have pictures sent to me?

288
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,270
宝贝
Hey, babe.

289
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,550
你看见我钥匙了吗
Have you seen my keys?

290
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:42,870
钥匙估计落在你那空头计划里了吧
I think you left 'em in the plan you never made.

291
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,600
你还挺幽默  不错啊  钥匙在这儿呢
So she's funny, too. That's good. My keys.

292
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,270
怎么样
So?

293
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,260
他人很好
He seems very nice.

294
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,200
亲爱的
Honey,

295
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:54,030
要在市区吃晚饭的话
we should get going if we're gonna get dinner

296
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,100
我们得赶紧走了
in the city first. ?Oh.

297
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,580
-我敢说那隧道肯定会堵车  -好吧
- I bet the tunnel's gonna be jammed. - ?Okay.

298
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,170
不要  留下来嘛
No, stay!

299
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,050
爸爸的同事吃不了多少的
Dad's work friend doesn't eat a lot.

300
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:02,700
-你们可以吃他那份  -真的吗
- You can have some of his dinner. - What?

301
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,710
爷爷奶奶要走了  宝贝女儿们
Grandma and Grandpa can't stay, girls.

302
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,400
况且一会儿我和同事还有事要出去呢
And, anyway, i've got an appointment with my work friend, so,

303
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,940
我保证后面会找你好好聊一聊的
I promise to catch up with you about all this.

304
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:13,860
说好咯
Promise?

305
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:16,860
米格尔  感谢你的不期而至
Miguel, ?thanks for dropping by unexpectedly.

306
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,270
重说  感谢顺路拜访
Rewind. Thanks for dropping by.

307
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:24,290
超爱这招  永远爱你们哦  再见
Always love it. Always love you guys. Peace.

308
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,250
他在隐瞒什么
He's hiding something.

309
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:32,990
我们该走了
Hey. We got to get goin'.

310
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:38,960
威廉
William?

311
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,400
威廉  你要去哪
William. Where you goin'?

312
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,650
-回家  -为什么  发生了什么事
- Home. - Why? What happened?

313
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:49,820
-我们预约了医生的  -你该取消
- We got the doctor's appointment. - You should cancel.

314
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,220
我为什么要取消...  你能上车吗
Why would I cancel... W-Will you get in the damn car?

315
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,570
我知道如果我告诉你我要离开  你会阻止我
I knew if I told you I was leaving, you'd try and stop me

316
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,830
正像现在这样
like you are right now.

317
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:57,770
你会设法阻止我
You'd try and stop me

318
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,680
是因为你父母教育你要做个好人
'cause you were raised to be a good man.

319
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:02,690
但那样养育你的人不是我  兰德尔
But I wasn't the one who raised you that way, Randall.

320
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,560
我今天想起来了
I was reminded of that today.

321
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:06,430
你有父母
That you have parents.

322
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,850
我不能在四十年后突然出现
That I just can't step in 40 years later

323
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:10,790
坐享别人的劳动成果
and enjoy the fruits of someone else's labor.

324
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,440
就这样了  你要走
So, just like that, you go?

325
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,810
不跟孩子们告个别
No good-bye to the girls?

326
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:15,870
-她们会没事的  -不  她们会很难过
- The girls will be fine. - No, they'll be devastated.

327
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,410
她们连我是谁都不知道
They don't even know who I am.

328
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:19,720
-听着  这个医生...-他要说的
- Look, this doctor... - He isn't gonna

329
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,330
我早就知道了
tell me anything I don't already know.

330
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:22,480
-但有可能  -不会的
- But he might. - ?He won't.

331
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,560
有可能
But he might.

332
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,640
而且我觉得他应该比
And something tells me he might be a little more thorough

333
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,640
你在哪个免费流动诊所找的庸医
than the doctor at whatever free homeless clinic

334
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,910
更了解你的病情
you've been going to to get your free medical counsel at.

335
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,000
更不用说为了帮你预约到他
To say nothing of the fact that I had to kiss up

336
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:37,640
我不得不去找公司里头号混蛋
to the biggest D-bag at my firm

337
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,360
拍马屁讨好他
just to get you this appointment.

338
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,460
所以没错  威廉
So, yes, William,

339
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,900
你现在就得上车
you are getting in the car right now,

340
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:45,400
然后我们去见这位医生
and we are going to this doctor's appointment.

341
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,480
然后我才能允许你
And then and only then will I give you permission

342
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,470
招呼都不打一声  就像个流浪汉一样
to hobble off like Hobo Joe without saying

343
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:52,050
一瘸一拐地走掉
so much as a good-bye.

344
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,960
把你丢在消防局这件事
Startin' to not feel so bad

345
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,160
现在没那么让我感到愧疚了
about leaving you at that fire station.

346
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,440
随便吧
Yeah, whatever.

347
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,070
白人们
Hi, white people.

348
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,340
我只是个友好的黑人邻居
Friendly neighborhood black man.

349
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:16,310
凯特  能在这拍一张吗
Kate, can I get one right here?

350
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,980
凯特  就在这  能给你拍一张吗
Kate? Right here? Can I just get one right here?

351
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,320
凯特  你穿的什么牌子
Kate? Who are you wearing?

352
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:21,350
-凯特  凯特  -你在干什么
- Kate? Kate? - What are you doing?

353
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:23,590
你真的在和泰勒·斯威夫特约会吗
Is it true that you're dating Taylor Swift?

354
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:24,820
你真的刚和泰勒·斯威夫特
Is it true that you just broke up

355
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,470
分手了吗
with Taylor Swift just now?

356
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,150
你在做什么
What are you doing?

357
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,800
给我一天时间
Give me just one day.

358
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,930
今天你是明星
One day where you're the star.

359
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,410
你在哪  我给你打了十来次电话了
Hey, where are you? I've called you, like, ten times.

360
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,950
听着  我们能雇人帮忙
Listen, um... Can we just hire one of those services

361
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:21,170
来家里打包东西吗
that comes in and, you know, packs everything for you?

362
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:23,050
我记得杰森·莫玛告诉我有个人专门干这个
I think Jason Momoa told me about a guy who does that.

363
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,710
我们赶紧找莫玛办公室的人问问他的电话
Let's get that number from Momoa's office.

364
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:25,950
他的助理...
His assistant. That, uh...

365
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:28,180
达哈拉·玛普哈纳  她好像叫这个
Dahala Mapuana, I think her name was.

366
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,940
要不就是帕蒂
Or was it Patty?

367
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,730
你记得杰森·莫玛吧  他是...
You remember Jason Momoa. He's the, uh...

368
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,010
他演的那个土著多斯拉克人
he's the original Dothraki guy.

369
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:35,260
我们在赛斯·格林家见过他  你在哪儿
We met him at Seth Green's house. Where are you, all right?

370
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,840
我快受不了了  赶紧接电话
I'm getting overwhelmed. Pick up the phone.

371
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,930
{\an8}10个未接来电

372
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,470
我们这是去哪
Where are we going? ?

373
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:43,030
别再偷偷唱歌了
Well, no more background singing for you.

374
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,470
你的声音太美妙了
Your voice is way too beautiful

375
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:46,320
只能在卫生间听到太可惜了
to only be heard in a bathroom.

376
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:48,580
今天你是主角  宝贝
Today is your day, babe.

377
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:51,550
我们正往你的第一个演出现场走
We are on our way to your first big gig.

378
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,090
-什么  -没错  我下载了
- What? - ?Yep, I, uh... I downloaded

379
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:57,600
《反反复复》的伴奏音乐
an instrumental copy of "Time after Time,"

380
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,200
找到个老式手提录音机
found an old boom box.

381
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,960
表演时间到  亲爱的
It's showtime, baby! ?

382
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,640
托比  我绝对不会
Toby, there is no way in hell

383
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,300
在一群人面前唱歌的
that I'm gonna sing in front of people.

384
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:08,500
那你就辜负了整个世界
Well, then you'll be depriving the world.

385
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:09,870
那世界不会有什么损失
Well, the world will live.

386
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:12,950
没错  可你的听众却损失了
Yes, but your audience may not.

387
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:15,430
到了
All right.

388
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:19,130
{\an8}梅厄老年人看护中心

389
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,980
搞什么鬼
?What the hell?

390
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:21,710
好了
Okay, so,

391
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,190
我的多莉姑姑就住在这里
my Aunt Dolly actually lives here.

392
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:26,670
我帮你约了下午三点的黄金到访时间
All right, I booked you in their prime slot, 3:00 p.m.

393
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,950
在他们吃果冻之后  午睡之前
It's right after Jell-O but before their nap.

394
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,300
首演的绝佳地点吧
Perfect place to break your seal, right?

395
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:33,150
记住  大多数人可能都昏昏欲睡了
Now, remember, most of 'em will probably be asleep.

396
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:34,760
没睡的人明天也会忘得一干二净
The rest won't remember this tomorrow.

397
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,170
而且他们大多都经历过二战
And most of them lived through World War II,

398
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:39,660
所以无论你唱得有多烂  他们都会不介意
so no matter how bad you are, they've seen worse.

399
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,720
来吧
Come on.

400
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:42,940
抱歉  需要为你铺个红毯吗
I'm sorry, do you need the red carpet?

401
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,490
-不用  -好了  来吧
- No. - ?Okay, come on.

402
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,830
瞧瞧
Well, now,

403
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:52,830
三个宝宝看上去都很棒  杰克
all three of these babies are looking very good, Jack.

404
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,150
强壮又健康
Very strong, very healthy.

405
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,460
那就好  那就好  因为有时候
Okay, good. That's good. 'Cause some-sometimes

406
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,350
一个宝宝的行为和另外两个不同
one does something different than the other two.

407
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:02,790
你就会...  胡思乱想
You just... you start spinnin' a little... ?

408
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,860
他们都非常健康
They're all doing very well.

409
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:06,810
好吧
Okay.

410
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:09,030
你俩最近如何
How are you guys doing?

411
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:13,210
还不错  是的  我们...
We're great. We're good. We're, um...

412
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,710
很疲惫  但还不错
tired but, uh, good.

413
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,340
丽贝卡怎么样
And Rebecca?

414
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:21,100
我这么问
I mean, I only ask because

415
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:24,060
是因为父亲一般不会单独带孩子来医院
it's a little unusual for the father to be here alone.

416
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:27,990
她只是需要好好休息一下
She just needed a little break, you know?

417
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:33,310
她...  她有点不在状态
She's... she's... she's not totally herself.

418
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:36,460
她有点...
I mean, she's a...

419
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,390
有点茫然  我猜吧
little dazed,I guess?

420
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:41,260
她跟宝宝们不亲近
She's not bonding with the babies.

421
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:45,020
尤其是凯尔  她跟凯尔不亲
And not with Kyle, mainly. You know? Not with Kyle.

422
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:48,860
她可能是有些崩溃了
I think she might be a little broken.

423
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,270
宝宝们好像让我妻子崩溃了
You know, I-I think the babies might have broken my wife.

424
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,980
你能治好她吧
You can fix her, right?

425
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,450
或者告诉我怎么治好她  我还指望...
Or you can tell me how to fix her? I was... I was hoping

426
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:00,790
-你能告诉我怎么治好她  -坐下  杰克
- you could tell me how to fix her. - Sit down, Jack.

427
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:19,050
她失去了一个孩子  杰克
She lost a baby, Jack.

428
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:21,140
你不能忽略这件事
You can't just dismiss that.

429
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,340
-我也一样  -对
- So did I. ?- Yeah.

430
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:28,700
可你化悲伤为行动了
And you took your grief, and you... channeled it into action.

431
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:32,400
以积极的态度跨过了那道坎
You willed yourself forward with positivity,

432
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,320
但丽贝卡...
but Rebecca has just...

433
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,250
她必须以自己的方式度过这关
She's gonna have to do this in her own way,

434
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,780
而你只能要给她足够的空间
and you're just gonna have to give her the space to do it.

435
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:42,730
如果她找不到办法呢
Yeah. What if she doesn't find her way?

436
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,260
-她会找到的  -你怎么知道
- She will. - ?How do you know?

437

正如同我知道
For the same reason that I know

438

442
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:58,020
所以我说的话  你最好别全信
so you got to take everything I say with a grain of salt.

443
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,470
我办公室里有个沙发
Now, look, there's a couch in there in my office.

444
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,050
不如你去那躺躺睡个觉

我今天一整天都很闲

我亲手把他们带到这世上  杰克
I brought them into the world, Jack.

449

我绝对有资格花几小时坐在这里
I am perfectly qualified to sit here and watch 'em sleep

450
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,170
看他们睡觉和拉屎
and crap themselves for a couple of hours.

451
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:19,550
去睡吧  走吧
Now go. Now.

-我妹没说错...  -伊莱恩在这儿 
- Oh, my sister was so right about... - Elaine's here.

00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,780
她在摔东西  我被锁在壁橱里了
She's trashing the joint. I'm locked in the closet.

515
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,430
疯女人伊莱恩吗  她怎么会在那儿
Insane Elaine? Why is she there?

516

我打电话给她的
I called her.

517
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:52,430
怎么会
How?

518
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:54,490
我把她的电话号从你手机上删了
I deleted her number from your contacts.

519
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,060
我从云备份里找到的
I found it in the Cloud.

520
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,880
你联系了疯女人伊莱恩
You called Insane Elaine?

521
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,270
我还和她上了床
And I had sex with her.

522
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,940
我告诉她我要搬去纽约
And I told her I was moving to New York,

523
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:05,290
-然后她就发疯了  -我没疯
- and then she went crazy. - I am not crazy!

524
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,160
为什么所有人都说我是疯子  为什么
Why does everyone call me crazy?! Why?!

525
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,850
搬家的事让我有些不知所措了
You know what? Um, I got a little overwhelmed with the move,

526
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:10,920
我一直在给你打电话  可你没接
you know, I tried calling you, but you're not picking up.

527
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,510
天
Oh, God.

528
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:14,750
她又在摔东西了  快过来
You know what? She's breaking things again. Get over here.

529
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:16,770
我马上过来
I will be right over.

530
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,170
我...
I am...

531
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,230
对不起  我得走了
I'm sorry. I have to go.

532
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:23,860
你其实没必要过去
Oh, but really, you don't,

533
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:26,070
你觉得你必须过去  这样想挺疯狂的
and it's kind of crazy that you think that you do.

534
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:27,890
托比  你不懂
Toby, you don't get it.

535
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:30,500
我们是双胞胎  跟常人不一样
We're-we're twins. We're not like regular people.

536
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:32,020
我小时候摔断胳膊
When I was a kid, broke my arm

537
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,950
他在十英里之外的地方疼哭了  懂吗
and he cried out in pain ten miles away, right?

538
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,840
我们就是那么紧密相连
We're that connected.

539
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:37,000
问题是我以为我们也是如此
I thought we were, too, is the thing.

540
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:41,120
凯特  我又不是疯子
Kate, I'm not some nut job who performs grand gestures

541
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,810
随便为一个约过几次会的女生弄这么大排场
for every girl that I go on a few dates with.

542
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:47,820
我喜欢你  凯特  我很喜欢你
I like you, Kate. I like you a lot.

543
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:52,340
但我做不到跟在你哥后面做男二号
But I can't... I can't play second banana to your brother.

544
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,050
你只能这样
You have to.

545
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,740
所有人都得这样
Everyone has to.

546
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:04,670
好吧
Great.

547
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,520
在纽约玩得开心
Have a good time in New York!

威廉  能来这边谈谈吗
William, will you join me out here?

549
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:16,390
威廉
William.

550
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:20,520
兰德尔  我也希望能带来好消息
Randall. I wish I had better news.

00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:22,790
癌细胞转移了
The cancer has metastasized

552
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:25,500
现在的情况  我们也爱莫能助了
to a point where there's really not much we can do.

553
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,210
现在有一些实验治疗方案
There are some experimental treatments.

554
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,350
说实话  效果还没有太大保障
Frankly, they haven't been very promising.

555
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,950
我状况不太好  你应该看得出来
I'm not very well, as you can probably tell.

556
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:54,880
孩子不是这些东西的产物
The baby didn't come from this.

557
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,200
是爱情的结晶
It came from love.

558
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,510
他妈妈
His mother?

559
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,240
我们是在那辆巴士上相遇的
You know, we-we... we met on that bus, actually.

560
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:08,800
我的世界都围绕着那一天旋转
My world spun on every axis that day.

561
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,700
第一次聊天时  我为她读了诗
I read poetry to her the first time we talked.

562
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:17,200
不是我写的
Uh, not any of mine.

563
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,660
我太害羞了
I was too shy for that.

564
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,570
是我最喜欢的诗人之一
One of my favorite poets, and...

565
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,370
她那时非常喜欢我读诗给她听
She used to love it when I read to her.

566
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,100
你们给孩子取了什么名字
So what'd you name the baby?

567
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:36,800
凯尔
Kyle.

568
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:40,320
我怀了三胞胎
I was having triplets, and, um,

569
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,040
我们就是一时兴起取了名字
on a whim, actually, we just decided to name them.

570
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,780
凯文  凯特和凯尔
Kevin, Kate and Kyle.

571
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:54,810
分娩过程中  我失去了一个孩子
I... I lost one of the babies during delivery,

572
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,870
但你的孩子
but your baby showed up

573
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:58,860
正好是那天早上出现在了医院
at the hospital the very same morning.

574
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:00,790
就像命中注定一样
It felt like destiny.

575
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,110
我...
Um... I just...

576
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:14,340
能见到你  我很感激
I appreciate this. I-I, um...

577
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:16,330
我之前很想知道他的经历
I wanted to know his story.

578
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,690
这些就够了  所以...
And that there was good here, so...

579
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:26,350
我能时不时去看看他吗
I wonder if I could check on him from time to time.

580
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,850
不  不行
No. No.

581
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:34,310
我还需要确定
I-I also need to know...

582
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:37,870
我需要确定你不会来找他
I need to know that you're not gonna come back for him.

583
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:41,870
我需要确定我能松下这口气了
I need to know that I can move forward.

584
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:45,330
因为他流着你的血
Because he will have your blood

585
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:48,690
睡在你给他包上的毯子里  但到此为止了
and the blanket you wrapped him up in, but that's it.

586
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:49,880
就仅此而已了  不然我...
That's the deal. Otherwise, I...

587
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,950
我了解
I understand.

588
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,380
好
Okay.

589
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:06,810
我和...
I'm not...

590
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:10,390
我和那个孩子不太亲
I'm not bonding with the baby.

591
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:14,310
我想爱他  对他视如己出
I want to love him like he's my own,

592
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,680
但每当我看着他的脸...
but every time I look at his face...

593
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,410
取一个属于他的名字
Give him his own name.

594
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:38,070
你给她读的诗  那个作者叫什么
What was the name of the poet you used to read to her?

595
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:39,340
你最喜欢的诗人
Your favorite poet.

596
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:58,580
{\an8}达德利·兰德尔 著

597
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:53,830
哪天你觉得合适了  就交给他吧
Maybe you'll see fit to give it to him someday.

598
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:04,110
谢谢你
Thank you.

599
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:27,380
进展如何
How'd it go?

600
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:28,970
不好
It's bad.

601
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,120
医生也束手无策  真的
Nothing to be done, really.

602
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,240
给了几个实验治疗方案
Some experimental treatments

603
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,010
可以让他再多活几个月
that'll give him a few more months.

604
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:39,360
他正在楼上休息
He's upstairs resting.

605
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:43,580
平静地将双手交叉放在胸前
Peacefully with his arms crossed over his chest, no doubt.

606
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,810
我怀疑自己是不是他亲生的
I have no idea how I came from that man.

607
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,250
我很遗憾  亲爱的
I'm so sorry, babe.

608
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:49,000
我也不知道自己在期待什么
Yeah, I don't know what I expected.

609
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:50,570
不  我知道
Yes, I do.

610
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,960
我希望我找到的父亲没有身患重病
I expected to find a father who wasn't so damn sick.

611
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,470
-兰德尔  -我该早点去找他  贝丝
- Randall... - I should have looked for him years ago, Beth.

612
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:59,710
这样孩子们就可以和爷爷多相处几年
I mean, the girls could have had a grandfather all this time.

613
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:02,570
可我现在把他接回家是为了什么
Instead, I brought him here so they could what?

614
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,390
让孩子们喜欢上一个垂死的人吗
Fall in love with a dying man.

615
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,400
所以你只是担心孩子们吗
So, this is about the girls, then?

616
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,920
你不希望她们喜欢上他
You don't want them to fall in love with him?

617
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:17,350
他到这里都一周了  宝贝
He's been here a week, baby.

618
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:19,700
你对他的了解
And you don't know any more about him

619
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,970
也并没有随着这段时间的相处而加深
than you did the first time he walked through that door.

620
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:27,480
我不知道你做这些事是为了什么
I don't know what you were looking for with all this,

621
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:29,010
即使你自己知道
or even if you do,

622
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:34,070
我也只想说  你的时间和精力是有限的
but I do know you don't have a whole lot of time.

623
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:11,020
-她走了吗  -走了
- Is she gone? - ?Yeah.

624
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:14,160
我希望你这个炮约得值
God, I hope the booty call was worth it.

625
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,270
值
It was.

626
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:19,150
我突然变得有些不知所措
I just started to get overwhelmed, you know?

627
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:22,080
我读了一本你给我的剧本
Started reading one of those plays you gave me.

628
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,550
你才读了一本
You actually read one?

629
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,410
事实上我全读了
I read them all, actually.

630
00:34:25,410 --> 00:34:28,240
但是这一本  特别出色
But, uh, this one, though, it's really good, you know?

631
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,600
真的很出色
Like, really good.

632
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,420
于是我有点不知所措
And I just started to get a little overwhelmed

633
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,810
因为我怕
'cause I felt like, um,

634
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:36,370
我怕自己配不上这么好的剧
I felt like maybe it was too good for me.

635
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:37,420
没有  凯文
It's not, Kevin.

636
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,350
真的  你能出演是他们的福气
It's not-- they would be lucky.

637
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:42,430
好吧...
Well...

638
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:50,890
我发现我交往的对象比伊莱恩还疯狂
So my guy turned out to be more insane than Elaine.

639
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,160
-托比  -听我说
- Toby? - ?Get this.

640
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,710
他把我带去一家养老院...
So he takes me to a nursing home...

641
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,530
让我在一群老人前唱歌
to sing in front of old people.

642
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,880
好让我在避免尴尬的情况下当一回明星
So I'd be a star but in a comfortable environment,

643
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,360
要不然我肯定会崩溃
'cause otherwise I would freak out.

644
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:04,990
一切都很完美
It was the whole works.

645
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:07,410
他准备了红毯  豪车还有礼服
He had the red carpet, he had the car, suit.

646
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:09,640
-那一切...  -很棒啊
- It was like... - Oh, that's good.

647
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,070
是的  在那之后
Yeah. And then afterwards,

648
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:13,770
我十分兴奋
like, I was on a high, like,

649
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:17,170
虽然这听起来很傻  但我感觉很自由
I know it sounds stupid, but I, I felt so free.

650
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:20,040
然后呢
Then what happened?

651
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,390
你打来了电话
Well, you called.

652
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:24,510
我说我要走  弄得他气急败坏
Told him I had to go and he got pouty and mean.

653
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:25,940
等一下  我竟然在那种关键时刻来电
Wait a minute, I called at that very moment

654
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:27,130
而你竟然还接了
and you actually answered the phone?

655
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:28,260
我当然接啊
Of course I answered.

656
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:34,640
反正我得专注到自己的减肥事业
Anyway, I need to focus on losing weight

657
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:36,360
还有我们的纽约梦上
and our big move to New York,

658
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,170
我根本不需要谈恋爱
and I don't even need to be in a relationship.

659
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:42,790
你被炒了
You're fired.

660
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:45,300
什么
What?

661
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,210
没错  凯特  你被解雇了
Yeah, Kate, you're fired.

662
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,010
为什么啊
Why?

663
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:56,140
你是你哥的私人助理
You're the personal assistant to your brother, all right?

664
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:59,530
一个把自己关在主卧壁橱里的哥哥
A brother who locks himself in his master bedroom closet.

665
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:01,480
这个壁橱又恰好
A master bedroom closet

666
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,130
附带着一个小酒吧
that happens to have a mini-bar in it.

667
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:07,630
也许我们该各自奋斗自己的事业了
Maybe it's time we go at it alone for a while, you know?

668
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:09,590
就一段时间  看结果如何
Just for a little while to see what happens.

669
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:11,710
也许我们该成熟一点
You know, maybe we need to grow up a bit.

670
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:24,810
不做你妹妹  我都不知道自己是谁
I don't really know who I am if I'm not your sister.

671
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:29,590
我知道
I do.

672
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:33,670
你肯定会喜欢她的
You're gonna love her.

673
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,160
我不喜欢你装暖男
I don't like it when you're sweet.

674
00:36:57,570 --> 00:36:58,850
我来了  什么事
Okay, I'm here. What?

675
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:02,030
对不起
I'm sorry.

676
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,840
好吧  但是道歉不能改变...
Yeah, well, sorry doesn't change the fact...

677
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,670
从来没有人像你今天这样
What you did for me today was the nicest thing

678
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:07,870
为我这么用心过
that anyone has ever done for me.

679
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:08,720
好吧  但还是...
Okay, but that still doesn't...

680
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,820
我不打算搬到纽约了
And I'm not moving to New York.

681
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:12,820
-但还是改变不了...-我为你准备了这个
- Okay, but that still doesn't change... - I got you something.

682
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:14,660
我接受你的道歉
I accept your apology.

683
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,210
-是吗  -是的
- Yeah? - ?Yes.

684
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:19,730
不准接电话
Don't you dare answer that.

685
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:21,090
我不接
I'm not.

686
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:22,890
-别接  -我不接
- Do not. - ?I won't.

687
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:24,160
留言给凯特吧
Leave a message for Kate.

688
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,570
凯特  很好  你没接电话
Oh, Kate, good. You didn't answer.

689
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:27,960
希望这表示你正"性"福着呢
Hopefully, that means you're having sex.

690
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:30,320
话说  我买票了
Anyway, I did it.

691
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,880
我订了去纽约的夜间航班
I-I booked a red-eye to New York.

692
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,780
我打算去了  因为...
I'm just gonna do it, 'cause, you know...

693
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,350
凯特  如果我们继续谈下去
Kate, if we keep talking about it,

694
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:36,440
就会劝自己别这么做
we'll talk ourselves out of it.

695
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:37,350
我不会去
I'll never go.

696
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,590
你不会留下  所以...
You'll never stay, so...

697
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:40,890
我不打算跟你道别
And I'm not gonna say good-bye

698
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,670
整多愁善感那一套
or anything sappy like that.

699
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:48,000
你懂我的感觉
You know how I feel.

700
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:51,000
就这样吧
Okay.

701
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,920
我不知道你这四个小时去哪里了
You know, I didn't know where you were the last four hours.

702
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:11,100
我知道
I know.

703
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,580
对不起
I'm sorry.

704
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,810
我以为你跑到墨西哥城
I thought you ran off to Mexico

705
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:17,010
不要孩子们了
and abandoned the kids.

706
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,030
我永远不会跑到墨西哥城
I would never run off to Mexico

707
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:26,080
丢下你和孩子们
and abandon the kids without you.

708
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:28,990
你保证
Promise?

709
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:31,100
我保证
I promise.

710
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:41,080
我忍不住去想我们失去的那个孩子  杰克
I can't stop thinking about the one we lost, Jack.

711
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:44,290
我一直想  我知道
I can't. I know...

712
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,020
我知道有了这些新生儿  我该开心才对
I know we have these new babies, and I should be happy,

713
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:52,540
但我就是忍不住去想他
but I just can't stop thinking about him.

714
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:00,710
我也是
Me, too.

715
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:03,790
-是吗  -是
- Yeah? ?- Yeah.

716
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,940
我满脑子都是这事
That's all I think about.

717
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:08,380
我感觉
I feel... ?

718
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:10,910
我想到他时  感觉很内疚
I feel guilty when I think about him,

719
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:13,490
然后  不想他时
and then, you know, I-I feel guilty

720
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:15,310
也感觉很内疚
when I stop thinking about him.

721
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,420
我也是
Me, too.

722
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,180
我以为只有我这样想
I thought it was just me.

723
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:23,940
不  我也这样想
No. It's me, too.

724
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:31,310
我爱你
I love you.

725
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:34,310
我也爱你
I love you, too.

726
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:45,100
我们得给他起个新名字
I think we need to give him a new name.

727
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,350
我觉得这很重要
I think it's important.

728
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:51,010
你怎么会这么想
Where'd you get that idea?

729
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:54,000
就是这么感觉的
I just thought of it.

730
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:19,390
进来
Come in.

731
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:30,000
很抱歉今天不如想象中顺利
I'm sorry today didn't go as we hoped.

732

I'm Snow White.

123
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,170
你没骗我吧
You're kidding me!

124
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:24,440
白雪公主是我一直以来最爱的角色呢
Snow White's my favorite character of all time!

125
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,250
其实我也在为一场演出试镜呢
I'm actually auditioning for a play, too.

126
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,940
场景非常暗  也非常接近生活--
Yeah, it's very dark, very, very truthful--

127
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,340
-快学下奶爸的声音  -什么
- Do the Manny voice. - What's that?

128
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,280
他们喜欢听你说那句口头禅
They love it when you do the catchphrase.

129
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,040
我不想再学奶爸的声音了
I don't want to do the Manny voice.

130
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,970
-拜托嘛  -拜托
- Please. ?- Please.

131
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,380
-宝宝说什么  -再像一点
- Baby say what? - ?Like, for real.

132
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:40,860
宝宝说什么啊
Baby say what?

133
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,260
不对  要像电视里那样
No, like in the show.

134
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,570
宝宝在说什么嘛
Baby say what?

135
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,120
两个超级粉丝啊
Your biggest fans.

136
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,070
不过不管怎样  我已经彻底告别这部剧了
Any... Anyway, this play is a total departure for me,

137
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:55,610
知道吗
you know?

138
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:57,240
奶爸什么的  都一刀两断了
None of that, like, Manny stuff.

139
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,420
这对我来说是剧中人物的告别
It's a character-driven departure for me.

140
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,270
你在听吗  你看什么呢
Where'd you go? What are you looking at?

141
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,100
兄弟  我得挂了
Hey, man, uh, I gotta go.

142
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,320
你就这样挂他电话啊
You're just gonna hang up on him?

143
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:10,640
不不不  我不会给你看身份证的
No, no, no, I will not show you my I.D.

144
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:13,390
除非你告诉我  你为什么要看
Not until you tell me why you need a reason to see it.

145
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,320
托尼  发生什么事了
Tony, what's going on here?

146
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,340
皮尔森先生  有人举报他四处徘徊
Hey, Mr. Pearson. We had a report of someone loitering.

147
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,630
我没有四处徘徊
I wasn't loitering.

148
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,730
我是在散步
I was taking my walk, and literally

149
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,390
确切地说是去品味玫瑰花香
on my way to smell the roses,

150
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,380
-就像上周一样  -我知道
- as I have been for the past week. - ?I know.

151
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,270
这里难道还有什么禁止赏花的法律
Is there some local rose smelling ordinance

152
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,740
-我没听说的吗  -威廉  够了
- I'm not aware of? - ?William, enough.

153
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,680
够了
Enough...

154
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,310
他是和你一起的吗  先生
He's with you, sir?

155
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:32,060
是的  他和我们住一起
Yeah, he's staying with us.

156
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:33,570
-不好意思  -还不好意思
- Sorry. ?- Sorry?

157
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,870
我们很抱歉
We're so sorry.

158
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,660
我们不知道情况  兰德尔
We didn't know, Randall.

159
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,010
明白  谢谢
Understood. Thanks.

160
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,340
谢谢你  托尼
Thank you, Tony.

161
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,480
我们得给你买些新衣服了
We're gonna get you some new clothes.

162
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:54,890
我讨厌甘蓝
I hate kale.

163
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:55,970
我也是
Me, too.

164
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:02,290
小芝麻菜和大芝麻菜一样难吃
Baby arugula is just as bad as grown-up arugula.

165
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,310
算了
All right, you know what?

166
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,180
我们买单吧
Here we go.

167
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:08,910
不行  不行  让我来...
Oh, no, no, no. Let me get--

168
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,060
别忘了  你失业了
Remember, you are unemployed.

169
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,500
而且我也不信你能
And I am not convinced that you would do well

170
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,570
-靠乞讨度日  -你在开玩笑吗
- begging for money. - Are you kidding?

171
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,010
你不觉得司机们要是看到
You don't think the drivers will be sympathetic to me

172
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,680
我举着个"没饭吃"的牌子会很同情我吗
holding up a sign that says "Hungry?"

173
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,130
那就好
That's good.

174
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,430
我去下卫生间  然后就走  行吗
I'm gonna use the restroom, and then we'll go, okay?

175
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:35,890
你过得怎么样
How are you?

176
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,740
-挺好的  你呢  -不错
- Uh, good. How are you? - ?Good.

177
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,210
好了  你要走了吗
Okay, uh... you wanna get out of here?

178
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:48,910
-那是谁  -哪个
- Who was that? ?- Who was...

179
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:53,200
你看到了啊  那是我前妻
You saw that. Uh, that was my ex-wife.

180
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:00,590
等下  你是说真的吗
Wait, are you serious?

181
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,720
是啊  我跟你说过我结过婚
Yeah. I told you I was married before.

182
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,300
可没说是这种
Not to that.

183
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:19,160
{\an8}我们的生活

Hey, Kate, stop being silly.

186
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,370

00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,250
-爱心熊  -好了  两张椅子了
- Care Bears! - Okay, that's two.

189
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,720
亲爱的  我是出卖肉体才换来的椅子
Babe, I had to sleep with someone to get this one.

190
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,220
-希望你原谅我  -我没问题啊
- I hope that's okay. - Yeah, I'm fine with it.

191
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,920
只要他老婆不介意就好
As long as his wife is okay with it.

192
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,870
凯文  到你了  把衣服脱了
Kevin, you're up, please. Shirt off.

193
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,620
为什么  我都不爱游泳
Why? I don't even like swimming.

194
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,940
你不一定头也要潜下去
You don't have to put your face in.

195
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:51,370
你可以待在浅水区  兰德尔会陪你的
You can sit in the shallow end and Randall will stay with you.

196
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,640
我也不喜欢兰德尔
I don't like Randall either.

197
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,830
-小凯  干嘛呢  -别说了
- Hey, Kev, come on. - Enough.

198
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:54,750
转过去
Turn around.

199
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,210
兰德尔  到你了
Randall, you're up, please.

200
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:00,600
过来吧
Come here.

201
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,920
转身
Turn around, please.

202
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:05,950
你确定我还需要涂防晒霜吗
Are you sure I really need sunscreen?

203
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,650
-肯定要  -要啊  当然
- Yes, absolutely. ?- Yeah, absolutely.

204
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:10,320
你当然要涂了
Of course you do. Sure.

205
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,350
三个小家伙  快过来
Okay, look, Big Three, come here.

206
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,280
过来  你们周围有很多大人
Come here. You are surrounded by adults

207
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,520
和同样是大人的救生员
and lifeguards that resemble adults.

208
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,230
你们应该不会遇上...
There's very little trouble you can actually get into--

209
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,930
等等  等下  凯特  宝贝
Wait, wait. Kate, baby,

210
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:22,030
你确定不再套件衣服吗
are you sure you don't want to put a shirt on?

211
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:23,630
-好吧  -给
- Right. - ?Here.

212
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,050
好好看你的书吧
Enjoy your Misery.

213
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,580
大家都盯着她的泳衣看  杰克
People are staring at her in that bathing suit, Jack.

214
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:30,850
那些小混球一定会说三道四的
Some jerky little kid is gonna say something.

215
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:32,000
那只是婴儿肥
It's baby fat.

216
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,950
她才八岁  孩子们这会儿什么都不懂
She's only eight years old. Kids haven't turned mean yet.

217
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:38,010
凯文最近是怎么了  态度那么差
And what is up with Kevin lately, and that attitude?

218
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,860
-他太嫉妒兰德尔了  -他没事
- He's so jealous of Randall. - He's fine.

219
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:43,090
宝贝  他没事  他们仨都很好
Babe, he's fine. They are all fine.

220
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,420
还有兰德尔需要抹防晒霜吗
And does Randall need sunscreen?

221
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,170
这些年来我们都是在他身上浪费防晒霜吗
I mean, have we just been wasting sunscreen all of these years?

222
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,100
这个我也不知道
That I have no answer for.

223
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,210
椅子  椅子
Chair. Chair!

224
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:53,480
小心点
Careful!

225
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,710
她只是他的前妻  凯特
She's his ex-wife, Kate.

226
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:59,310
好吗  关键字是"前"
All right? The operative word being "Ex."

227
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:01,150
他们已经离婚了  他现在和你在一起
They're not together anymore. He's with you now.

228
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:03,760
可为什么呢  你真该瞧瞧她
"Why?" is the question. You should see her.

229
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,520
{\an8}凯文

230
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,310
也许那才是托比想要的
Maybe that's what Toby wants.

231
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:07,320
也许他看上我是为了满足他的胖妞癖
Maybe he's fulfilling a fat-girl fetish with me.

232
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,860
确实有这种癖好
Well, that's actually a thing.

233
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,430
当然  对我来说
Of course, for me it was

234
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:11,040
那更像是一阶段  但也差不多
more of a phase than a thing, but anyway...

235
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,930
我仔细调查了下这女人
I did a deep dive with this woman.

236
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:14,370
她的一切都如此完美
Everything reeks fabulous.

237
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,480
完美的品位  完美的朋友
She has fabulous taste, she has fabulous friends.

238
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,210
她还去过阿根廷  凯文
She's been to Argentina, Kevin!

239
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,910
听我说  我把你留在洛杉矶
Listen to me, I did not leave you in Los Angeles

240
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,610
不是让你自我糟践的
so you could self-sabotage, okay?

241
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,590
所以赶紧把网页关掉  立刻马上
So get off the Internet-- do that right now--

242
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:27,070
告诉我怎么做才能通过试镜
and tell me how hard I'm gonna crush this audition.

243
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,760
边缘消失了
The edges are gone...

244
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,130
事情也随之发生了
and then the thing.

245
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,080
谢谢你  肖恩·帕特里克
Thank you, Sean Patrick.

246
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:38,270
我觉得有几个人挺不错
Some good choices, I thought.

247
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,460
丹尼尔不错  其他人演得烂透了
It's Daniel. Everyone else sucks.

248
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:41,740
其实我更喜欢...
You know, I kind of liked--

249
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,920
就选丹尼尔
It's Daniel.

250
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:46,120
稍等  稍等
Hold on, hold on.

251
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,380
还有一位  凯文·皮尔森
We have one more. Kevin Pearson.

252
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,780
对不起  我知道  很抱歉我迟到了
Sorry. I know, I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm late.

253
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,890
我本来想坐地铁  再一路走过来
It's just, you know, I tried to take the subway, right,

254
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:54,510
像纽约客那样
and then walk, like a New Yorker.

255
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,040
我是罗恩·希勒
Ron Shiller.

256
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,470
这位是斯隆·桑德伯格
This is Sloane Sandberg.

257
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,210
-你就是编剧  -剧作家
- You're the, uh, screenwriter. - Playwright.

258
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:02,950
你总是要迈出第一步的
Well, you know, I mean, you gotta start somewhere.

259
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:07,920
今天你和梅英小姐对戏  如果你不介意的话
You'll be reading with Miss Maine today, if that's okay.

260
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,360
当然  和谁都行
Yeah, no, whatever you got, you know.

261
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,370
缅因州小姐  爱荷华州小姐
Miss Maine, Miss Iowa.

262
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:12,220
我曾评选过支持特朗普美国小姐
I judged, uh, Miss USA for Trump once,

263
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,330
所以我们可能见过面
so we may have actually met before.

264
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:17,120
梅英小姐全名是奥利维亚·梅英
Miss Maine is Olivia Maine.

265
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,660

在开始之前  我有...
Well, before we start, I just wanted to...

269
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,330
我有几句话必须要说
I want to get something off my chest.

270
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,910
我知道你们的看法
I do understand the perception, you know.

271
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,400
洛杉矶的演员们来到这里
These L.A. actors, they come out here, right?

272
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,740
来剧院里随便演几个小角色
They do their little quick stint in theater

273
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,340
只为满足自己的虚荣心
just to feel better about themselves.

274
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,800
而我却不是  好吗
That's not why I'm here, okay?

275
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:41,020
我来这是有正当理由的
I'm here for the right reasons.

276
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,290
那我们赶紧把这戏对完吧  可以吗
Let's get this over with, shall we?

277
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:58,760
你想让我先开始吗
Did you want me to start?

278
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,560
没错  我觉得那样比较好
Yes, I thought it would be good, if,

279
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:01,950
你先说  我后说
you speak, then I speak,

280
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:03,670
接着你再说  然后我们就可以回家了
then you speak, and we all go home.

281
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,700
你觉得可以吗
Does that work for you?

282
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,070
行啊  很好
Yeah. That's great...

283
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:17,570
我的记忆有点模糊了  这一天实在太漫长了
My recollection's hazy, actually, it was a long day.

284
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:20,780
我可不是  早上九点前我的一天就结束了
Not for me. Mine was over before 9:00 in the morning.

285
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,310
你的口音真棒
That's really good... accent.

286
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:24,750
-你说什么  -美国口音
- What? - ?The American accent.

287
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:26,180
什么
What?

288
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:29,070
我正...  努力融入角色
I just... diving... diving right back in.

289
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,480
台词是...  "我躺在"  我不...
It say, uh... it says "I lay," uh, I don't...

290
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,420
我说...我不需要说这个  台词是...
Let me just say... I don't need to say it. It says...

291
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:38,420
我还是说吧
I'll just say it.

292
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:39,760
我躺在...
I lay...

293
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,990
继续继续
Just keep going.

294
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,420
真是...
This is...

295
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,590
我能搞定
I'll get it.

296
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,690
我整夜躺在码头上
I lay on the dock all night,

297
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:50,040
直至天明
and part of the next morning.

298
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,090
却感受不到任何东西
And I don't feel a thing.

299
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,000
我再来一遍
Let me take that again.

300
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,620
我的天  我的天
Oh, my gosh... Oh, my gosh.

301
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,020
好的  宝贝说什么...
Okay. Baby say what...

302
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:03,830
好了  我躺在...  让我酝酿下
Okay. I-I lay... Let me get into it.

303
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:08,250
我整夜躺在码头上直至天明
I lay on the dock all night and part of the next morning.

304
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,450
却感受不到任何东西
And I don't feel a thing.

305
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,710
蚊虫叮咬  皮肤晒伤  都没有感觉
The bug bites, the sunburn. Nothin'.

306
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,980
就像我们以前一起去钓鱼时  你还记得吗
It's like when we used to go fishing. You remember?

307
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,280
-我从没钓过鱼  -你是下一句...
- I never fished... - Do you have the next...

308
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,560
-你搞什么鬼  -对不起
- What the hell? - ?Sorry.

309
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:27,880
你没说话  我还以为...
You weren't talking, so I thought...

310
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,280
这叫停顿
It's called a pause.

311
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,170
是
Right.

312
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:35,020
抱歉  我的剧本上没写有停顿...
Sorry. It doesn't say pause on my script...

313
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,870
上面也没写烂呢  可我们现在不就是这样吗
Well, it doesn't say suck, either, yet here we are.

314
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,070
你知道你的尺码吗
You know your size?

315
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,220
我总是挑修身的穿
Always tended toward the slim.

316
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,610
估计现在也还没变吧
I don't see that changing much at this point.

317
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,690
试试这些
Try these.

318
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,610
完了我们顺路去一趟药店
Afterwards, we'll swing by the pharmacy,

319
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,090
把医生给你开的药拿了
get those medications that the doctor wrote for you.

320
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,430
听起来挺好的
Sounds like a plan.

321
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,520
一百美元
$100?

322
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,020
就是这个价
It's what they cost.

323
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,710
我买单  你就买吧
I'm paying, just take the pants.

324
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,060
我们要不要谈谈
So are we gonna talk about it or not?

325
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,400
谈什么
Talk about what?

326
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,040
谈什么  谈今天早上的事
About what. Uh, this morning.

327
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:23,790
还是你就想臭着张脸却什么也不说
Or are you content to stand in silent judgment with that face?

328
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,290
我的脸平时就这样
It's just my face.

329
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:27,800
不  你是不喜欢我替你道歉
No, you didn't like me apologizing for you.

330
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,430
我懂
I get it.

331
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:31,600
如果我把事情闹大你是不是就高兴了
Would you have been happier if I made a big scene?

332
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,440
揍托尼一顿
You know, got up in Tony's face,

333
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,010
把警察招来然后对着我们喷水枪
had the cops roll up and turn the hoses on us?

334
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:37,560
他们是卡斯格拉夫一家
It's the Cosgroves.

335
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,950
先生开了一家保险公司  妻子收藏猫头鹰
He runs an insurance agency, she collects owls.

336
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:43,300
历史可不会站在我们这一边
History would not have memorialized our stand.

337
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,850
你被水枪喷过吗
You ever had a hose turned on you?

338
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:46,380
很抱歉  我没有过
Can't say that I have, I'm very sorry.

339
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,810
不要尝试  很疼的
Don't be. It hurts.

340
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,080
就是这个表情
And there's that face.

341
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,470
我就是这种表情  我还想买几双袜子
Only face I got. Look, I could use some socks...

342
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,570
这个表情  就好像是在说你胳膊上
No, the face. The one that says I have a scar

343
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,890
还有当年为送孩子们上学留下的疤痕
on my arm from integrating schools.

344
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,790
说不定脚上还有为自由游行时留下的水泡
And probably blisters on your feet from marching for freedom,

345
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:02,410
至于我  因为我成长于白人家庭
but me, because I grew up in a white house,

346
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:04,990
你就认为我不懂黑人的生活
you think I don't live in a black man's world.

347
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,990
你知道你是什么表情
Oh, you know the one.

348
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,590
你的表情让那个营业员从我们进门那一刻起
The one where that salesman there has been eyeballing us

349
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,970
就一直盯着我们
ever since we came in here.

350
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,680
还有那个保安的位置挪动了一点点
Or where that security guard has moved just a little

351
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,890
只为更好地监视我们
off his mark so he can keep us in his sight.

352
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,120
还有他们肯定会在我付钱的时候
And where they'll definitely ask

353
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,600
请我出示信用卡的用户证明
for an ID with my credit card when I go to pay,

354
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:19,980
尽管他们从没向其他人提出过这样的要求
even though they haven't asked for anybody else's.

355
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,810
再加上每天类似这样的无数件小事
Plus a million things every day

356
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:24,750
我都要选择无视
that I have to choose to let go,

357
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:28,180
这样我才不会把自己气死
just so I'm not pissed off all the time.

358
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,690
就像我今早在街上做的一样
Like I did on the street this morning.

359
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:33,620
就和我每天做的事一样
Like I have done every day of my life.

360
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,850
快去试试你的修身无褶休闲裤吧
Now try on the damn slim cut flat front chinos.

361
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,690
你穿着肯定好看
I think they'll look nice on you.

362
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:51,670
兰德尔
Randall

363
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,740
看
Watch!

364
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:55,410
太酷了
Cool! Cool!

365
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,990
爸  看我  爸
Dad, watch! Dad!

366
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:00,200
-另外一个去哪儿了  -我在找
- Where's the other one? - I'm looking.

367
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,420
天啊  只要一秒钟不盯着一个
Man, you take your eyes off one for a second,

368
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:03,550
其他的就也都不见了
you lose track of the others.

369
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,060
那是因为他们人数
That's because there are more of them

370
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,250
比咱俩多呀
than there are of us.

371
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,580
永远都会是这样
Always will be.

372
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:09,040
什么
What? Oh.

373
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,030
在说孩子们呀
Talking about the kids.

374
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:12,710
是啊  他们人多势众
Yep. It's a war. They got the numbers.

375
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,360
-爸爸  爸爸  -我们还没开始就累趴了
- Dad! Dad! - We were beat before we started.

376
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,890
-看我  -她在那儿呢
- Watch! - There she is.

377
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:17,340
你们好
Hi. Hey, guys.

378
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,620
想玩美人鱼吗
You want to play mermaids?

379
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:20,530
这是我们所有人写给你的
This is from all of us.

380
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,410
爸爸
Dad!

381
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:27,970
爸爸  爸爸
Dad! Daddy! Dad!

382
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,090
爸爸  快看我
Dad, watch me!

383
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:30,360
好  我看见你了
Yeah. I see you, pal!

384
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,320
还记得他第一次叫我爸爸的时候 
Do you remember the first time he said "Dad"?

385
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,400
我有多高兴吗
How happy I was?

386
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,520
兰德尔去哪儿了
Now where's Randall?

387
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,180
怎么样  你们看见了吗
How about that time? Did you see?

388
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,970
小凯  你弟弟呢
Hey, Kev. Where's your brother?

389
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,950
我不知道
I don't know!

390
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,310
杰克
Jack.

391
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:43,620
你去岸上找  我看看水里
You take land, I'll take sea.

392
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:46,280
爸爸  快看我
Dad! Watch!

393
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:47,130
凯文
Kevin.

394
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,330
你们应该互相照看对方的
You were supposed to watch each other!

395
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:51,510
兰德尔
Randall!

396
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,460
兰德尔
Randall!

397
00:15:58,710 --> 00:15:59,900
凯特  这真是史上
Kate, it was the worst audition

398
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,770
最糟糕的一次面试了
in the history of the world. Okay?

399
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:02,840
那女的搞得我超级紧张
I mean, that woman made me so nervous,

400
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,120
中途我居然无缘无故地
I started doing an English accent

401
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,680
说起了英式口音
in the middle of it for no reason!

402
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,490
肯定没有那么糟吧
Okay, I'm sure it wasn't that bad.

403
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:08,480
也许这才是问题所在
Maybe that's the problem. You know?

404
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,670
-我太想得到这个角色了  -这不是奶爸吗
- I wanted it too much. - Hey! It's the Man-ny!

405
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,450
奶爸  最近怎么样
Hey Man-ny! How's it going?

406
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:14,380
听着  你能不能坐飞机过来
Yeah. Listen. Could you please fly out here?

407
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,710
我现在真的很需要你
I really need you right now.

408
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,580
你会没事的  只要...
You'll be fine, you just...

409
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,560
我只要什么  怎么不说了
What? I'm just what? Where'd you go?

410
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,290
{\an8}出售

411
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:22,170
没什么  我在逛街
Nowhere. I'm here. I'm shopping.

412
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:23,910
-我好迷茫  -你这不是迷茫
- I'm lost. - You're not lost.

413
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,800
只是一切对你来说都太陌生了
It's just all new. It's just new.

414
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,150
不是  我是说我真的迷路了
No... I mean I'm actually lost,

415
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:30,360
我完全不知道我现在在哪儿  我先挂了
I have no idea where the hell I'm at. I got to go.

416
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,680
抱歉
Sorry. Oh.

417
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,030
刚刚发生的事  我想说

-我到处...  -没事的  我看着他呢
- I've been... - It's okay. I'm watching him.

465
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:00,060
好的  现在有我来照顾他了  抱歉
Okay, it's... I-I have him now. I'm sorry,

466
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,340
我是他妈妈  我差点吓坏了  我叫丽贝卡

没错  如果一个白人家庭带着一个黑人小孩
Oh yes. When a white family has a black child

470
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,790
也没有向我们介绍过自己
and they don't introduce themselves to any of us,

471
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,650
我们一般都会多加注意
we tend to take notice.

472
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:15,870
谢谢你照看他
Well. Thank you for watching him.

473
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:17,890
只是他不该在这儿的
He's just not supposed to be over here.

474
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,840
不是说这里有什么不好
Not "over here" like that.

475
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,620
来这儿没什么不对
There's nothing wrong with over here.

476
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:28,470
我的意思是他应该待在我们的视线范围内
I just mean that I want him where we can see him,

477
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:30,190
也就是我们坐的地方  我们面前
where we're sitting, in front of us.

那是我的儿子  我是他妈妈
That's my son, and I'm his mother.

483
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,080
我不知道你是不是
And I don't know if you have

484
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,480
对这样的家庭有什么意见
some sort of problem with that arrangement,

485
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,840
但是我真的不在乎

486
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,100
总之谢谢你帮我照看我们的孩子
Thank you very much for watching my son.

487

00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:53,330
-好吧  -好的

489
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,740
你应该带孩子剪一个合适的发型了

剃刀都把他脖子划伤了
The razor bumps on his neck.

491
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:02,420
你需要找个知道怎么理黑人头发的理发店
You need a barber who knows how to cut black hair.

492
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,580
走吧
Come on.

493
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,610
我跟你说了让你跟哥哥待在一起  不是吗
I told you to stay with your brother, didn't I?

494
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:09,550
对不起
Sorry.

495
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,740
这就是你想来这个泳池  不去其它泳池的
Is this the real reason you wanted to come to this pool

496
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,730
真正原因吗

00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:16,220
走吧
Come on.

从未见过如此一位肌肤如雪的美人

这位绅士  您又是从哪里来呢
Where are you from, noble sir?

您来到这森林中又是所为何事呢
What errand brings you to the forest?

506
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,660
我来自遥远之地

那部剧真的很特别  对吗
That play is really special, isn't it?

509
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,840
我的意思是  虽然我没有读过很多剧本
I mean, I don't read a lot of plays,

510
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:24,750
-但那个很不错  -我明白
- but that's -- that's good. - Yeah. Yeah, I got that.

511
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:26,660
听着  那部剧...
No, look, it's...

512
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:28,430
真的很棒
it's really good, actually.

513
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:30,640
我是说  很精致
I mean, it's... it's fragile.

514
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,950
微妙而细致
It's -- it's delicate.

515
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,490
你从哪里来的  凯文·皮尔森

516

我吗
Me?

517
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:40,400
我老家在匹兹堡
Uh... Pittsburgh, originally.

518
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:41,850
你的家人在匹兹堡吗
You got family back there?

519
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:43,970
现在不在了
Um... not anymore.

520
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,800
所以现在你以洛杉矶为家了
Right, so, L.A. is home now?

521
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,790
应该是吧
Yeah, I guess so.

522
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:50,540
是啊
Yeah.

523
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,980
我觉得你应该回去
I think you should go back there.

524

我是认真的
I am serious.

而且是以朋友的身份告诉你
And I'm telling you this as a friend

528
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:06,080
因为这种事我见得太多了
because I see this all the time.

529
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,970
你自己也说了
I mean, you said it yourself.

530
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:10,870
演过电视剧和电影的帅哥美女来到这
Pretty people come here from TV or movies

531
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:12,730
因为他们想来点真格的
because they want to do something real.

532
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:13,830
即便他们...
I mean, even if they've...

533
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,490
他们一辈子都不曾真诚过
they've never had a genuine moment in their entire lives.

534
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,730
你知道他们明白了什么吗
Do you know what they find out?

535
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,320
猜猜看
That guess what?

536
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,100
太难了
It's hard.

537
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,900
实在是太艰难了
It's so hard.

538
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,740
并不是...
It's not...

539
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:26,770
不是装出来的
it's not pretend,

540
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:30,080
{\an8}1955年美国著名喜剧片

541
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:30,080
这可不是在高中食堂里演什么《红男绿女》
it's not Guys and Dolls in some high school cafeteria.

542
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,160
不是...
It's not...

543
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,010
不好意思  你演的那部电影叫什么来着
I'm sorry, what-what-what was the-the movie you were in?

544
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,320
实际上是部电视剧
It was a TV show, actually,

545
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,670
名叫《靓男保姆》
called, uh, The Man-ny.

546
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:38,660
是啊  听我说
Yeah, and look,

547
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:39,460
我不是说
I'm not saying that

548
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,740
这个角色你演得不好
you're not good at what you do.

549
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,930
我相信你肯定...
I'm sure you're...

550
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,100
肯定非常出色
you're great at it.

551
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:44,890
我就演不了这个角色
I mean, I-I couldn't do it.

552
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,380
但你演电视剧和这里是两码事
But this... is not that.

553
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,640
你的能力不够
You're in over your head,

554
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,410
凯文·皮尔森
Kevin Pearson.

555
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:53,730
如果你真想演这个  就回家去
I mean, if you really want to do this, then go home,

556
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:56,010
报个班  学习一下
find a class, get some training.

557
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:59,080
我是实话实说
I'm just being honest.

558
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:00,490
我懂了
I see.

559
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,460
以朋友的身份
As a... as a friend.

560
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,690
-是的  -好吧
- Yeah. - Yeah.

561
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,500
可我还是觉得
Still, just, you know, it feels like

562
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,180
"朋友"这个词你用错了
you're using the word "Friend" wrong.

563
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,500
出什么事了吗
Everything all right?

564
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,760
-你还好吗  -还好
- You okay? - Yeah.

565
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:14,660
真的吗
Yeah?

566
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,380
好着呢
Yeah.

567
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:18,960
你拿到了那个角色
You got the part.

568
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,000
等一下  不好意思  你说什么
Wait, I'm sorry, what?

569
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:22,130
他们觉得"保姆"来演会热卖
They think the nanny will sell tickets.

570
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:29,130
其实是《靓男保姆》
It was actually The Man-ny.

571
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,810
爸  快看  我要潜下去了
Dad, look! I'm going under and everything!

572
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,400
爸爸
Dad!

573
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,040
-我看着你呢  伙计  -兰德尔
- Yeah, I see you, pal! - Randall.

574
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:37,040

575
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,930
-爸爸  -也许她只是
- Dad! - You know, maybe she was just

576
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:40,260
-想帮个忙  -爸爸  看我
- trying to be helpful. - Dad! Watch!

577
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:43,390
居高临下地教我怎么养孩子  就这么帮忙吗
By condescendingly telling me how I could raise my kid? Yeah.

578
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,880
-不了  谢谢  -爸爸
- No, thank you. - Dad!

579
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:57,520
*我爱我爸爸  很爱很爱他*
*I love my father and I love him well...*

580
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:03,730
*希望不久后的某一天能见到他*
*I hope to see him someday soon*

581
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:09,490
*我爱我爸爸  很爱很爱他*
*I love my father and I love him well*

582
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:15,330
*希望不久后的某一天能见到他*
*I hope to see him someday soon*

583
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,510
*因为我住的地方  到了晚上又黑又暗*
*'Cause where I live  It gets dark at night*

584
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,230
*那种黑暗会吞噬光明*
*The kind of dark eats up the light*

585
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,220
*我住的地方  到了晚上又黑又暗*
*Yeah, where I live  It gets dark at night*

586
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,960
*那种黑暗会吞噬光明*
*The kind of dark eats up the light*

587
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:42,740
*你知道的妈妈*
*And you know that, mother*

588
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:46,710
*我在说谎*
*I'd be lying*

589
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,690
*如果我说我不怕夜晚*
*If I didn't tell you I'm afraid of night.*

590
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,550
凯特  你怎么不吃东西
Kate, you're not eating.

591
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:51,430
你还好吗
You okay?

592
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:53,820
她怎么了
What's up with her?

593
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:03,020
逗我呢吧  为什么
Are you kidding me?! Oh! Why?

594
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,060
因为我们没让她穿T恤  就因为这个
Because we didn't make her wear a T-shirt, that's why.

595
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:07,220
不  杰克  这只会让情况更糟
No, no, Jack, you're only gonna make it worse.

596
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:08,060
坐下
Sit...

597
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,620
坐下  真的
Sit down. Seriously.

598
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,060
我差点就淹死了
I almost drowned!

599
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:12,510
-什么  -你们留意过我吗
- What? - Did you even care?

600
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:13,870
-什么时候  -我都要潜到池底去了
- When? - I tried to get to the deep end,

601
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:15,680
-可你们看都不看我一眼  -冷静下来
- but you never watch me. - Hey. Calm down.

602
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,040
-你总是盯着他们  -凯文  凯文
- You always watch them. - Kev, Kev, Kev.

603
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,120
-好了  -别碰我
- Come on... - Don't touch me.

604
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,320
当心点儿  孩子
Watch yourself, pal.

605
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:22,420
你们一直忙着不让凯特吃得太多
And you're so busy making sure that Kate's not eating too much...

606
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,430
凯文  冷静一下
Kev, calm down.

607
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,420
还要不让兰德尔觉得自己是被领养的
and... and Randall's not too adopted,

608
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,690
可这个时候凯文去哪了呢
and meanwhile, where's Kevin?

609
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,470
你们猜猜看
Oh, guess what?

610
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:30,830
他死了
He's dead.

611
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:31,850
孩子  我们爱你  我们看着你呢
Bud, we love you. We were watching...

612
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:32,640
别碰我
Don't touch me.

613
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,620
交给我吧
I got this one.

614
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:36,370
过来  过来
Hey, come here. Come here.

615
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:37,950
-干什么  -抱歉  抱歉
- What? - I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

616
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,000
对不起
I'm sorry.

617
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,300
好吗  我该一直看着你的
Okay? I should have been watching.

618
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,110
-好吗  -你是该看着我
- Okay? - You should have.

619
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:43,450
我承认错误  我该一直看着你
And I said I was and I should have been watching you, pal.

620
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:44,320
我在努力  好吗
I'm trying, okay?

621
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,800
听我说  我知道我比你年纪大
Look, I know that I'm bigger than you.

622
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,000
我知道我是成年人了
I know that I'm an adult,

623
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:49,970
但我也是第一次经历这些  好吗
but I... th-th-this is my first time, okay?

624
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:51,450
我也是第一次
This is my first time, too.

625
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:54,400
我有了你们三个  我在努力
I got three of you and I'm trying.

626
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,240
对不起  我本该在你身边的
I'm sorry. I should've been there.

627
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:58,300
我以后都会在你身边的  好吗
And I'm gonna be there, okay?

628
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:00,180
好
Okay.

629
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,180
能给我一个拥抱吗
Can I have a hug?

630
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,550
能说句"爸爸我爱你"吗
Can I get a "Dad, I love you"?

631
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:27,180
你有理发师的名字吗
Do you have the name of a barber?

632
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:30,610
有
I do.

633
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:34,570
劳烦你告诉我
Well, I would appreciate it.

634
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,680
我写给你
Then I'll write it down.

635
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,480
他上岸之后
When he gets out of the pool,

636
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,030
你得给他涂点乳液
you need to put lotion on him

637
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:45,150
不然皮肤会变灰
or he gets ashy.

638
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,270
乳液  好的
Lotion. Okay.

639
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,480
谢谢
Thank you.

640
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,730
我儿子平时放学后
Do you think that my son could play with yours

641
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:56,890
能跟你家小孩一起玩吗
sometime after school?

642
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,900
当然
Yeah, yeah.

643
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:04,110
没问题
I think we can do that.

644
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,890
还有他到底需不需要涂防晒
And does he need sunscreen or not?

645
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:08,540
是要的吧
He does, right?

646
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,510
我觉得要
I thought he did.

647
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:14,670
我就知道
I knew he did!

648
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:17,410
你能帮我跟我老公说说吗
Can you tell my husband that, please?

649
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:19,820
我没带简历  抱歉
Uh, I didn't bring a resume, sorry.

650
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,280
我不知道要面试
I didn't think I'd have a job interview.

651
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,060
我以为就是拿张申请表
And I thought I would just pick up an application...

652
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:25,620
既然都来了  那就聊聊吧
Oh, well, you're here and I'm here, let's talk.

653
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,770
你皮肤真好
You have really pretty skin.

654
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:32,180
谢谢
Oh, thank you.

655
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,720
你也是
So do you.

656
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,530
谢谢
Thanks.

657
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:38,500
凯特  你对我和我的店的背景有了解吗
So, Kate, do you know anything about my store or my background?

658
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:41,030
一点点
Hmm... A little.

659
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,810
我知道你在2013年开了这家店
I know that you've had this store since 2013

660
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:46,410
在这之前你开网店卖你的独立设计
and before that you sold your own designs on Etsy,

661
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:47,460
直到后来你跟人合伙
until you partnered with that woman

662
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,510
是你加州大学圣克鲁兹分校的同学
that you met at UC Santa Cruz--

663
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:50,690
加油  香蕉蛞蝓[UCSC吉祥物]go, banana slugs--

664
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:52,050
你去泰国参加了她的婚礼
at her wedding in Thailand.

665
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:53,810
太美了
Oh, so beautiful.

666
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:55,720
简直是梦想之旅
Like, that is my dream trip.

667
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,860
后来你进口了这些围巾
And then you imported those scarves

668
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,520
生意从此走上了正轨
then it just, like, took off from there.

669
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,840
还有你离婚了  没有小孩
Oh, and you're divorced, you have no kids

670
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,930
你戴宽檐帽的样子太好看了
and you look amazing in wide-brimmed hats.

671
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,500
我猜的
I assume.

672
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,890
你头型很适合
You just have the head for it.

673
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:10,470
我不适合  我戴着就像个奶嘴
I don't. I look like a pacifier.

674
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:19,120
我喜欢面试前做足功课的人
I like a person who does her research before an interview.

675
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:21,590
我最会做功课了
I'm a big researcher.

676
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,610
还好吗
Hey, what's up?

677
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:29,300
好消息是我找了份工作
So, the good news is: I got a job.

678
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:32,970
意思是还有坏消息
Well, that means that there's bad news.

679
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,700
{\an8}严禁奔跑

680
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,400
成人游泳时间
Adult swim.

681
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,110
小孩都上岸
Adult swim only.

682
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:54,570
你冷吗
You cold?

683
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:58,830
T恤呢
T-shirt?

684
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,290
我没带
I didn't bring one.

685
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,460
那...
Well...

686
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,120
我带了件T恤
I brought a T-shirt.

687
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,550
妈妈讨厌这件
That's the one Mommy hates.

688
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:11,020
妈妈只是妒忌
Oh, Mommy's just jealous.

689
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,230
我不觉得
I don't think so.

690
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:13,070
是真的
Well, it's true.

691
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:14,630
她只是假装讨厌
She just pretends like she hates it

692
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,060
因为我不给她穿
because I won't let her wear it.

693
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:19,630
你知道这件衣服从哪来的吗
You know where I got this shirt?

694
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:22,690
我听妈妈说是个瘾君子流浪汉的
I heard Mommy say it was from a drugged-out drifter.

695
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,630
妈妈不太了解情况
Listen, Mommy doesn't know the whole truth,

696
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:28,730
你别跟别人说  好吗
so this is gonna have to stay between us, okay?

697
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:30,960
我当时
I got it...

698
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,920
在佛罗里达
in Florida.

699
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,370
一个叫代托纳比奇的神奇的地方
A magical land called Daytona Beach.

700
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:37,540
我们能去那吗
Can we go there?

701
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,680
不行
No.

702
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:42,750
你不能去代托纳比奇
No, you may never go to Daytona Beach.

703
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,940
我要你大声说出来
I want you to say it out loud:

704
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,890
"爸爸  我绝对不去代托纳比奇"
"Daddy, I will never go to Daytona Beach."

705
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:49,300
爸爸  我绝对不去代托纳比奇
Daddy, I will never go to Daytona Beach.

706
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,210
乖
Good girl.

707
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:51,820
我当时就在那
But I was there...

708
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,750
一天晚上  我在回酒店的路上
and one night, I was walking back to my hotel,

709
00:30:57,010 --> 00:31:00,580
然后遇见了一个人
and... I came across this man...

710
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:02,300
一个旅客
a traveler.

711
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:03,500
他穿得破破烂烂的
He was wearing ragged clothes

712
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:06,310
口音很奇怪
and he had a strange way of talking.

713
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:10,430
有三个坏蛋在欺负他
And these three young jerks were bothering him.

714
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,060
他们想拿走他的一袋生活用品
They were trying to take away his bag of groceries.

715
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:16,230
所以我把那些坏蛋赶跑了
And so... I chased the jerks off.

716
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,180
你一个人
By yourself?

717
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,270
是的  就我一个人
Yeah, by myself.

718
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:20,680
我之前喝了几杯
And I had a few...

719
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,990
维他命饮料  把他们赶跑了
vitamin drinks and... I chased them off.

720
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:26,200
真事儿
It happened.

721
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,530
这个旅客非常感激
And the traveler was so grateful,

722
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:29,930
想报答我
he wanted to repay me.

723
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,830
但他有的东西不多
You know, he-he didn't have much,

724
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,970
所以他把手伸进他的小包里
so he reaches into his little satchel

725
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:36,810
掏出了这件衣服
and he pulls out this shirt.

726
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:41,340
他跟我说这是件有魔法的T恤
He says to me that it's a magic T-shirt.

727
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,900
他说
He said,

728
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:44,860
当你穿上它的时候
that when you wear it,

729
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,580
你的对手就会看到你希望他们
your enemies will see you exactly as

730
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,050
看到的样子
you want to be seen,

731
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:50,500
而且只能看到那个样子
and only that way.

732
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,210
无论你想成为武士也好
Whether it's a... a warrior,

733
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:55,180
公主也好
or a princess.

734
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,350
任何形象都行
Whatever you want.

735
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:58,240
-真的有用吗  -你说呢
- Does it work? - You tell me.

736
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:01,850
我遇见你妈妈那晚  就穿着这件衣服
I was wearing this shirt the night I met your mom.

737
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:05,280
她当时觉得我是世界上最帅的男人
And she thought I was the handsomest man in the world.

738
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:06,870
-你吗  -是啊  
- You? - Yeah, I know.

739
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:07,660
就是我
Me.

740
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:10,970
魔法
Magic.

741
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:22,730
我选择做公主
I'm gonna go with princess.

742
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:30,860
你得知道...
I want you to know...

743
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:33,660
就算没有这件衣服
that your daddy already sees you that way

744
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,920
你也一直是爸爸的公主  你不需要它
without the shirt, okay? You don't need it.

745
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:40,140
谢谢爸爸  不过我还是要穿着它
Thanks, Daddy, but I'm gonna wear it anyway.

746
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:45,810
好啦
Okay.

747
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,160
公主陛下
Your Highness.

748
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:51,980
我来给你找个皇冠
Need to find you a crown.

749
00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:00,280
老天  这不可能
Oh, my God, this is not happening.

750
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,160
这事...  你真的...
This is-- are you-- oh.

751
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:06,570
托比
Toby.

752
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:08,980
你是在告诉我
So you're telling me

753
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:12,800
你要为我前妻打工吗
that you work for my ex-wife?

754
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,950
我原来没这个打算  只是顺其自然而已
I didn't mean to, okay? It just happened.

755
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:16,380
我只是想近距离看看她
Like, I-I wanted to see her up close.

756
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:20,100
所以你...  就像个连环杀手一样跟踪她
So you... just stalked her like a serial killer.

757
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,240
乔茜和我更愿意称之为"做功课"
Josie and I prefer to call it "research."

758
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,160
"乔茜和我"
"Josie and I."

759
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:24,480
"乔茜和我"
"Josie and I"?

760
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,910
怎么又来了个"乔茜和我"
Wha-- how in the hell is there a Josie and I?

761
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:27,750
我也不知道
I don't know.

762
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,340
-我只是想知道  -想知道什么
- I just had to know. - Know what?

763
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:32,810
托比  这事对我来说比较特殊
Toby, one of these things is not like the other, okay?

764
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:36,080
我想知道  她是不是从很胖减肥成这样的
So I wondered, like was she fat and then she got skinny?

765
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,230
她是不是个讨厌的人  可答案都是"不"
Was she a terrible person? But no.

766
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,210
她是那么美貌  出类拔萃
She's actually beautiful, and she's great,

767
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:41,360
她还夸我很棒
and she thinks that I'm great,

768
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,530
她给店里进的货也很有品味
and she has amazing taste in imported goods.

769
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:45,230
摸摸这个
Like, feel this.

770
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:47,350
我根本不知道这是啥东西
I don't even know what that is!

771
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,600
是个公文包
It's a portfolio.

772
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:49,800
我很喜欢
And I liked it.

773
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:51,570
那种是你喜欢的类型吗
Is that what you want?

774
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,530
是你喜欢的吗  你是不是喜欢身材窈窕的人
Is that what you want? Do you want a skinny person?

775
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:57,150
不是  不过我喜欢和正常人在一起  凯特
No, but I would like to be with a sane person, Kate.

776
00:33:58,860 --> 00:33:59,620
这话可不好听
That is not nice.

777
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,330
好吧  也许我已经对说好话厌倦了
Yeah, well, maybe I'm a little tired of being nice.

778
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:05,380
有个陌生人说你很棒  你就信了
Some stranger tells you that you're great and you believe her.

779
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:07,770
可是我说你很棒  你就觉得我在骗你
I tell you you're great and you think I'm lying.

780
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:08,510
到底为什么
Why is that?

781
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:10,580
我不...  我不知道  我有问题
I don't... I don't know. I have a problem.

782
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:12,030
我们都有一堆问题  凯特
We all have problems, Kate.

783
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,220
托比  我的一生...
Toby, all of my life...

784
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,760
你一直很胖
You've been fat.

785
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,440
我知道
Yeah, I get it.

786
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,060
我很理解你
I empathize, clearly.

787
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:22,260
我理解你  所以逗你开心
I empathize, then I say something cute,

788
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,730
你高兴起来  然后又消沉  如此反复
then you feel better, rinse and repeat.

789
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:27,890
她对我很糟糕  凯特
She was terrible to me, Kate.

790
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:34,020
乔茜  这个身材窈窕又成功的女人
Josie, this skinny, successful woman

791
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:36,500
你真的那么崇拜她吗
that-that you admire so much?

792
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,500
她出轨了  她骗了我
She cheated on me, she lied to me,

793
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:40,710
然后拿走了我一半的积蓄
and then she took half my life savings.

794
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:43,760
她离开我一年后
I gained 95 pounds

795
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,870
我体重一下长了近九十斤
in one year after she left me.

796
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,290
在我最低谷的时候  我跟我弟弟说
At my lowest point, I told my brother

797
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:51,940
我要自杀  当然那不是真的
that I was committing suicide even though that wasn't true

798
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:55,340
我只是想让他和我一样感到恐惧和孤独
because I wanted him to be as scared and lonely as I was.

799
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,100
你知道吗  你知道吗  其实...
You know what? You know what? That's...

800
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,800
我没说实话  我...
That's a lie, I, uh...

801
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:04,790
我确实想过自杀
I did consider suicide.

802
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,180
很多次
A lot.

803
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:09,300
那时候我以酒浇愁
When I would get drunk,

804
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:11,630
形单影只
alone,

805
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:14,350
连自己都厌恶自己
and disgust myself.

806
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:20,600
所以  面临问题的并不只有你一个  凯特
So, you haven't cornered the market on problems, Kate.

807
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:26,580
天啊  我实在很抱歉
God, I'm really sorry.

808
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:35,000
我的烦恼不会一夜之间烟消云散  托比
My issues are not gonna go away overnight, Toby.

809
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:36,060
好吧
Well...

810
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:39,930
我也不会
neither am I.

811
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:42,510
不过  凯特...
But Jesus, Kate...

812
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,110
乔茜和我
Josie and I

813
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,110
以前相处并不愉快
weren't good together.

814
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:56,530
今后也不会
So we're not.

815
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:01,900
不管怎样  我还是要去她那里打工
It's not like I was gonna keep the job anyway.

816
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,720
但你知道谁和谁相处很愉快吗
But you know who are good together?

817
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:08,370
马特·劳厄尔和萨维纳·格思里
Matt Lauer and Savannah Guthrie?

818
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:08,370
{\an8}《今日秀》节目的主持人搭档

819
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:11,400
我爱他们俩
I love them.

820
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:13,210
我希望他们成为我的家人
And I want them to be my family.

821
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:14,740
还有我们俩
And also us.

822
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:15,990
我们在一起相处也特别愉快
We're pretty good together.

823
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:21,430
但我主要在说马特·劳厄尔和萨维纳·格思里
But mostly I was talking about Matt and Savannah.

824
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,970
我能留着这个公文包吗
Can I keep the portfolio?

825
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:27,950
天啊  真要命
Oh, my God, you're killing me.

826
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:29,860
不行
No.

827
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,770
你就不想摸一下吗
Do you just want to feel it?

828
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,010
天啊
Oh, my God.

829
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,580
这是什么啊
What is that?

830
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,530
是小宝宝什么的吗
That's a baby something.

831
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,510
请给凯特留言
Leave a message for Kate.

832
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:50,200
是我
Hey, hey, it's me.

833
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:52,440
我拿下那个角色了
I got the part.

834
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:54,940
算是...  很棒吧
Yay, right? I think.

835
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,600
能给我回电吗  就是...
Can you call me? Uh, it's just, you know,

836
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,780
一般都是你告诉我有多棒
you're-you're usually the one who... who tells me how great I am,

837
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:00,670
而你不在我身边
and you're not here.

838
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,120
所以...
So...

839
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:20,450
天  苔丝今晚演的白雪公主不一般啊
Man, that Tess was some Snow White tonight, huh?

840
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,380
是啊
Yeah.

841
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:29,900
我好像冒犯到你了
I've offended you somehow.

842
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:32,860
-没有  -不  我有
- No. - No, I have.

843
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,320
-你觉得我是在评判你  -我...
- You think I'm judging you. - I...

844
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:45,980
因为我没资格对你品头论足
Because I'm in no position to judge you whatsoever.

845
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:48,720
但是你要知道
But you need to know,

846
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,010
如果我有资格评判你
if I was in a position to judge you,

847
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:52,490
那也是很高的评价
you'd be getting a very high score.

848
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:56,280
那段在匹兹堡帮黑人儿童上学的经历
That story you told about helping to bus little black kids in Pittsburgh.

849
00:37:56,330 --> 00:37:59,090
-86年  87年的事吗  -差不多吧
- That was '86, '87? - Thereabout.

850
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:00,200
你那时没吸毒
So you were clean then?

851
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,020
还能正常生活
Just... functional?

852
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:05,960
你知道我这个黑人小孩那时的情况吗
Because you know what this little black kid was doing?

853
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:07,590
-我不...  -我是个孩子
- I don't... - I was a little boy,

854
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:10,280
住在宾州的伯特利公园
living in Bethel Park, Pennsylvania.

855
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:13,540
那边生活的大多是白人
Which is pretty much the whitest place on Earth.

856
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:16,230
我有个小本本
I had this little notebook...

857
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:19,450
每次我新认识一个黑人
and every time I met a new black person,

858
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:23,040
就在那个小本本上标记一下
I would put a mark in this notebook.

859
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,810
每次遇见一个黑人男子  我就心想
And every time I met a black man, I wondered if, somehow,

860
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:32,200
这个男人有没有可能是我父亲
if that man could possibly be my father.

861
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:33,820
但我不能说
But I couldn't say that.

862
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:36,200
不能说出来
You know, I couldn't say it out loud

863
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,740
因为我爱我父亲
because I loved my father.

864
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,620
我的白人父亲
My white father.

865
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:43,880
还有我的白人母亲
And my white mother.

866
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:54,750
我是个内心强大  事业有成的黑人
I'm a strong, successful, black man.

867
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:57,380
我和我妻子在育儿方面
My wife and I give a lot of thought

868
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:00,020
-真的花了很多心思  -我信
- to how we raise our girls, believe that. - Yes.

869
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:02,370
我女儿不觉得自己演白雪公主
The fact that my daughter doesn't find anything unusual

870
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:03,930
有何不妥
about her playing Snow White?

871
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:06,630
就体现了这个教育理念
That's the whole idea.

872
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:08,320
对吧
Right?

873
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:14,370
我并非无所不知  威廉

00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,450
凯文大伯
Uncle Kevin,

88
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,240
你为什么在书上乱写乱画
why are you writing in your book?

89
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,820
小宝贝  这是剧本
Play, sweetheart. It's a play,

90
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,700
导演希望我能做点场景表演
and the director wants me doing scene work.

91
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,990
可你似乎一直在写
You seem to be doing a lot of writing.

92
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,600
因为太多人告诉我该怎么做了  威廉
Well, I seem to be getting a lot of direction, William.

93
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:22,760
其实  你的声音很不错
Tell you what. You got a great voice.

94
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,140
有没有试过配音
You ever do any voice-over work?

95
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,600
应该试试
Well, you should.

96
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,000
真的  你可以去演...
Really. I mean, you could be a...

97
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,500
比如动画影片里的猫头鹰
like a... like a... like an owl in a Pixar movie,

98
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,890
-对吧  -开玩笑
- right? ?- Yeah.

99
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:34,920
-无意冒犯  -这有什么冒犯的
- No offense. - Not sure why I would take offense to that.

100
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:37,630
我不吃蓝莓
Oh, I don't do blueberries.

101
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:40,090
-我也不吃  -你啥时候开始不吃了
- Me neither. - Since when?

102
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,540
-今天开始  -是吧
- Since now. - Yeah.

103
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,680
都不说味道如何
It's not the taste, right?

104
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,420
蓝莓皮那个口感  太恶心了
It's the texture of the skin, it's gross.

105
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,690
我也不想吃蓝莓了
Yeah. I don't want blueberries either.

106
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,550
好的没问题  请问还有没有其他忌口
Yeah. Understood. Uh, any other dietary restrictions

107
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,630
我跟厨房的人说一下
I should let the staff know about?

108
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,060
算了  你那么忙
No, man. You're busy. I'll just, you know,

109
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,030
回头我有空给你列个单子吧
I'll make a list for you later when I get some time.

110
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,410
谢了
Thanks, buddy.

111
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,980
你得先吃点东西垫垫胃  威廉
You need to put something in your stomach, William.

112
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:05,500
吐司  药片和果汁  按这顺序来  好吗
Toast, pills, juice. That's the order. Okay?

113
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,590
你是在吃药吗
Is that medicine?

114
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,020
你是不是感冒了  爷爷
Do you have a cold, Grandpa?

115
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,590
-爷爷没事  -只是维生素
- Grandpa's fine. - No. They're just vitamins.

116
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,380
这么说
So.

117
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:24,720
她俩知道他是爷爷
You, uh, told the girls that he's Grandpa,

118
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,330
但不知道他病了  对吗
but not that he's sick. Right?

119
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,490
这样很冒险
That's ballsy.

120
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,360
凯文
Hey, so, Kevin, uh,

121
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:34,080
自从那天你过来
it's been a few days now, you know,

122
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,020
-就一直住在这里  -也没提前打电话
- since you showed up. - Without calling.

123
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,510
-对  -见到你我们很开心
- Right. - And... and it's great to see you.

124
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:41,200
就是想问下...
I was just sort of wondering...

125
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,140
怎么问比较礼貌呢
How do I say this politely?

126
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,230
你什么时候走
When are you leaving?

127
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:45,810
对  就这意思
Yeah. Yeah.

128
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,810
这个啊
Yeah.

129
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,880
我  我  这个 我随时...
No, I mean, come on. I can, I... I can, um...

130
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:54,490
我随时可以走  就是...
I can get out of here whenever. I just... I...

131
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,870
我想着顺便可以来陪陪你们
I saw this as an opportunity to hang with you two,

132
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,820
还有俩小宝贝  不过...
you know, and the girls, but, uh...

133
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,950
其实说实话  这个剧本
Plus I... honestly, this play, guys,

134
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,820
让我有点头疼
it's kicking my ass a little, You know? ?

135
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:06,930
而且一个人住酒店太孤独了
And it's so lonely at that hotel.

136
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:08,590
我一个人住个大套间
I mean, I got this big suite all to myself,

137
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:11,280
但是房间越大  就越寂寞
but I guess the bigger the hotel room, the emptier it can feel.

138
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:12,730
我就坐在那儿
You know? I'm sitting there.

139
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,390
虽然那里有八百针的高质量床单
I got that 800 thread count sheets.

140
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,560
迷你冰箱里也有吃不完的小吃
I got the endless minibar snacks.

141
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,650
还有高级的燕麦香皂和长毛绒睡袍 
You got the fancy oatmeal soaps, plush robes

142
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:19,760
而我就只坐在那儿
and all I can do is sit there

143
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,100
默默地想着
and think about how...

144
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,100
太安静了
quiet it is.

145
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,470
-我们要了  -什么
- We'll take it. - What's that?

146
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,150
酒店  我和贝丝  我们今晚就去住
The hotel. Beth and I, we'll take it, tonight.

147
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,080
不  兰德尔  我们临时去哪找保姆呢
No, Randall. Where are we gonna get a sitter?

148
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:30,980
不  我们有两位家人
No, We got two family members

149
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,080
-不不不  -免费住在咱们家
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no. - living in our house for free.

150
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,310
有一个还在电视上演过保姆
One of them played a nanny on TV.

151
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,600
不不  实际上是换工住宿生
No. ?No, actually, an au pair.

152
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,120
准确的说  我在电视上演的是个换工住宿生
Technically, I played an au pair on TV.

153
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,620
这两者是有区别的  很多人都不知道
There's a difference. A lot of people don't know that.

154
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,440
我饰演的是一个换工住宿生
I was... an au pair.

155
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,100
他们本想管这剧叫什么《换工住宿生》  但...
They were gonna call the show what Au Pair, but the...

156
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,270
叫"保姆"效果更好  我可以照顾孩子们
Manny tested better. I-I can watch the girls.

157
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,040
-我去收拾行李  -好
- I'm-a go pack. ?- Okay.

158
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,380
我现在去收拾行李
I'm-a go pack right now.

159
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,650
早安
Good morning.

160
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,660
在床上吃早餐
Breakfast in bed?

161
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:02,550
是的
Yeah.

162
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,840
我做了什么能享受这种待遇呢
What did I do to deserve this?

163
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:05,990
说不好啊
I don't know.

164
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,460
你为我做了太多贴心的事
You've done a lot of really nice things for me,

165
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,790
所以我想回报你
so I wanted to return the favor.

166
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:12,350
把"硬纸板"切成方块  放到碗里
Oh. By cutting up cardboard into little squares

167
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,560
来回报我吗
and putting it in a bowl?

168
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,670
这些是奶酪块
Those are cheese squares.

169
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:16,420
"美味啊"
Oh, yum.

170
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,580
上面是什么
Yeah. What's on top?

171
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,640
大麻籽
Oh, hemp seed.

172
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,640
大麻籽洒在上面
Hemp seeds on top?

173
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,160
你可真会避重就轻
Boy, you really buried the lede.

174
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,760
我要吃啦
?Now I'm in.

175
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:29,420
怎么了  你不要吃点什么黑暗料理吗
?What? You're not gonna have any nonsense made-up food?

176
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,490
不  下午我们的互助会上还要称重的
No. Getting weighed at our meeting this afternoon.

177
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:34,370
你知道吗
You know what?

178
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,040
我也是
So am I.

179
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,470
我或许也不该吃了  该死的
I probably shouldn't eat, either. Damn.

180
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,950
互助会结束后  你想做什么
?Hey, what do you want to do after the meeting?

181
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,200
我想去打迷你高尔夫
I was thinking miniature golf.

182
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,400
上一次  我不到20杆就打进了18洞
Last time I was like, 20 under going into the 18th,

183
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,770
但那个迷你风车捣了乱
but that little windmill owns my ass.

184
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,580
去不了  要看钢人队比赛
I can't. Steelers.

185
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,620

With who?

188
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,640
没别人  就我一个
Oh, no one. Just me.

189
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,330
好吧  我陪你一起看
All right. I'll watch with you.

190
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,360
不用了  谢谢  我自己看就行了
Oh, no. Thanks, but I'm good.

191
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:04,660
真的吗
Seriously?

192
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:07,280
你宁愿一个人看也不愿和我一起看
You'd rather watch by yourself than watch with me?

193
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,210
是的  那是我的个人爱好
Yeah. It's my thing.

194
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,360
我有这个习惯  你懂吧  个人爱好
I have a little ritual. You know? It's my thing.

195
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:13,370
好吧  你的个人爱好...
Well, your thing...

196
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,760
很悲哀啊

197
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:16,770
我不觉得
Not to me.

198
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:17,650
好吧
Okay.

199
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,350
好吧  不如这样吧
Okay. How about this?

200
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,820
你可以看橄榄球
You can watch football...

201
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,510
你一个人看
all by yourself,

202
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,180
这很正常  但是要和我一起
which is totally normal, but with me.

203
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,280
托比
Toby. ?

204
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:29,340

00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,560
{\an8}第十四届超级碗

220
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,950

Not an empty seat anywhere.

221
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:21,490

00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,080
-真抱歉我们迟到了  -没事的

226
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,880
-真是对不起  -都是因为孩子
- Oh, I'm so sorry. - Damn, kids, man.

227
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,520
我们正准备出门
We were just about to head out the door,

228
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,270
小宝宝就开始呕吐
and the baby decides to projective vomit

229
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,240
吐得小安迪满身都是
all over little Andy.

230
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,050
-也差点吐到我身上  -你猜安迪做了什么
- Almost got me, too. - So, what does Andy do?

231
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:37,940
你知道的  才四岁  体型像坦克一样
You know, four years old, built like a tank.

232
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,020
他扇了小宝宝一耳光
He slaps the baby.

233
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,070
就扇在脸上  啪的一声
Right across the face. Pow!

234
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:42,450
-不是吧  她还好吗  -她没事
- No! Is she okay? - Oh, she's fine. Yeah.

235
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:43,620
然后小宝宝就开始拼命尖叫
But then the baby's screaming bloody murder,

236
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,400
我也朝安迪喊
I'm screaming at Andy,

237
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,330
我就站在那儿  身上都是呕吐物  我就说
and me, standing there, covered in vomit, and I'm like,

238
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:47,860
安迪  她还是个婴儿
Andy, she is a baby.

239
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,460
你竟然扇了一个婴儿一巴掌
Like, you literally slapped a baby.

240
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,160
这真是帮了个倒忙  可想而知
Which really helped, as you can imagine.

241
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,160
没错  安迪也开始哭
Of course, then Andy starts crying,

242
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,410
-小宝宝哭  保姆也哭  -去喝点东西吧
- baby's crying, babysitter's crying. - We need drinks!

243
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:56,030
我们去喝点东西吧  一会就回来
We need drinks. We'll be right back.

244
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:56,770
好的
Okay.

245
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:02,480
跟我保证我们永远不要孩子
Promise me we are never having kids.

246
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,770
该喝点炮弹酒了
I think it's time for shots.

247
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:06,840
有人被扑到了
Somebody's down.

248
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,940
26号球员今天运气不好啊
26 is having a tough day.

249
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:16,070
{\an8}我们的生活
第一季  第五集

250
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,410
公羊队上半场竟以13比10的比分
The first half, the Rams, surprisingly,

251
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:27,480
-领先匹兹堡钢人队  -真逊啊
- lead Pittsburgh 13 to 10. - Pathetic.

252
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,770
没有办法阻挡进攻
Can't stop the run.

253
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,040
布拉德肖真烂
Oh, and Bradshaw sucks!

254
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:32,500
不  布拉德肖会在下半场爆发的
Oh, no, Bradshaw's gonna have a huge second half, though.

255
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,620
对吗  亲爱的
Right, babe?

256
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,820
是的  下半场大爆发
Yeah. Big... big second half.

257
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,110
你还好吗
Are you okay?

258
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,190
很好
Mm. Fine.

259
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,880
好吧
Okay.

260
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,620
其实不好
Actually, no.

261
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,520
你之前那话是什么意思...
What did you mean before when, uh...

262
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,460
就是你说...
when you said...

263
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,750
"跟我保证我们永远不要孩子"
"Promise me we'll never have kids"?

264
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,910
我不该那样说的
Oh. I shouldn't have said that.

265
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,440
没错  但是你说了
Yeah, but... you did.

266
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,630
今天好像说了两次
Kind of said it twice today.

267
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,300
我不该说的
And I shouldn't have.

268
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,300
好吗
Okay?

269
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:06,800
对不起
Sorry.

270
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,410
你们知道我们该怎么做吗
You know what we need to be doing?

271
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,090
我们该多给弗兰科传球  对吧
We need to be feeding the ball to Franco more, right?

272
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:14,770
-这才...  -我们从来都不谈这事
-That's... -?'Cause we-we never really talk about it.

273
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:19,140
我现在也不想谈这事
And I don't want to talk about it now, either.

274
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,270
我们总是说以后再说
We always say we're gonna talk about it in the future,

275
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,790
但现在就是谈的时候了  小贝
but it's the future now, Bec,

276
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,640
我想要孩子
and I want kids.

277
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,210
我们再去吧台拿几杯酒过来
You know what, we're gonna go grab another drink at the bar.

278
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:30,000
看看粉丝们的情况
and see how the fans--

279
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,790
现在我们来谈谈姜饼人和保罗·宏纳
Let's go to the Ginger Man and Paul Hornung. ?

280
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,670
洛杉矶粉丝们肯定高兴坏了  保罗
L.A. Fans have to be happy, Paul.

281
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,540
睡觉时间是八点和九点
Bedtimes are at 8:00 and 9:00,

282
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,720
八点刷完牙  九点要上床
that's teeth brushed, in the bed. 8:00 and 9:00.

283
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,380
就是茴香酒就着安眠药喝下去
So one Sambuca to chase down the Ambien,

284
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,750
然后就熄灯  对吧
and then lights out, right?

285
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,040
玩笑开过头了
That's too far.

286
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,320
听着  放心吧
Okay, listen, relax.

287
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,530
我们今晚会乖乖待在家的
We're gonna have a nice, quiet evening at home. Okay?

288
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,840
孩子们玩自己的
The girls are gonna play.

289
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,890
我要熟记台词  背下来
I'm gonna memorize my lines and get off book.

290
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:51,700
声明一下  一般情况下
Look, we want to make it clear that we're not normally

291
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,350
我们是不会晚上单独留她们在家的
in the habit of leaving the girls overnight.

292
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:56,920
更别说交给俩没怎么和孩子们打过交道的人了
Let alone with two men who probably haven't been around kids that much.

293
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,820
其中一个还把自己的孩子遗弃在了消防局
One of them's best known for leaving a kid at a fire station.

294
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,470
天  请千万要照顾好我的孩子们
Oh, my God, please, take care of my babies.

295
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,690
还有  请别给我们打电话
And, please, don't call us.

296
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:03,770
不不  如果需要我们就打电话
No, no, call us if you need us.

297
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:04,490
最好别需要我们
But don't need us.

298
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,800
在你们走之前  还有一件事
Oh, one more thing, though, before you go.

299
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,380
苔丝就是
So, Tess was the, uh,

300
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,840
喜欢喝白葡萄酒  是吧
the white wine drinker, right?

301
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,960
然后安妮喜欢喝红酒  我可不想搞混了
Annie likes the red 'cause I don't get that wrong.

302
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:12,830
惹得她们不高兴
Piss them off.

303
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,050
还是有点过头了  我从你们的表情看出来了
It's still too far. I can tell by the way you...

304
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:15,200
玩笑是有点过头了
Yes. ?It's a little too far.

305
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,040
-他太不正经了  -没关系的
- He plays too much. ?- It's okay.

306
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:17,860
-没关系的  -太不正经了
- It's okay. - He plays too much.

307
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,470
如果有需要就给我们打电话
Hey, call us if you need anything.

308
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,170
别打电话
Don't call us.

309
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:27,530
我在控制饼干食用量方面有问题
So, I have, you know, this-this issue with-with cracker control,

310
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:30,480
我发现很有帮助的方法
so what I've been finding to be really helpful ?

311
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,830
就是...
is if I...

312
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,690
把饼干从盒子里拿出来
take the portion out of the box

313
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,940
然后把饼干放在盘子上
and then I put the portion onto the plate

314
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,280
-把盒子  -递过去就行了
- and then I put the box - Just pass it.

315
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:43,030
放得远远的  然后我就知道我只能吃
away, and then I know how-how many crackers

316
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:45,040
多少块饼干了
I'm allowed to-to have.

317
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,450
递过去就行了
Just pass it.

318
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,190
多少块饼干
To h -- to have.

319
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:51,700
我知道了如果我只能吃十块饼干
So then I know that if-if I'm only allowed to have ten crackers,

320
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,750
我就只放十块饼干在盘子里
then I have the ten crackers on my plate,

321
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,740
这挺好的  但是同时
which is fine, but at the same time,

322
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,760
对于一些饼干来说
there are other crackers that I like than-than

323
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,310
我更喜欢吃另外的几种饼干
other crackers. So, I might not like

324
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:01,350
比如我更喜欢吃芝士饼干
saltine crackers as much as I like

325
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,730
而不是很喜欢苏打饼干
a Cheez-It type cracker,

326
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:04,990
{\an8}你被邀请参加托比的"钢人队"派对

327
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:05,950
那么我对于芝士饼干
but so, what I'll do with the Cheez-It type cracker

328
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:08,120
{\an8}触地得分  加油钢人队

329
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:07,990
我也许会多放几块在盘子里
is maybe put a little bit more on the plate,

330
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:08,970
但我还是会严格控制数量
but I'm still rationing,

331
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:12,350
所以如果是苏打饼干  我会放十块在盘子里
so if I have a saltine, then I might put ten on the plate,

332
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,890
如果是芝士饼干  就会放二十块
but there might be 20 if it's a Cheez-It. ?

333
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:15,840
但我还是会把盒子拿开  所以
But I still put the box away. So, I-I mean

334
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,510
我觉得这也算是一种胜利吧
I-I think that's -- that's a win.

335
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,800
她总是出差
She was always away on business.

336
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:34,780
我已经习惯孤独了  但是这...
So, I was used to being alone but this, you know, this...

337
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:35,580
这是另外一种孤独  
but this was a different kind of alone.

338
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:39,260
她总是出差  我已经习惯了...
She was always away on business, so I was used to being...

339
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,430
但是  我...
but... so, I was...

340
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,450
她总是出差  我已经习惯孤独了
She was always away on business, so I was used to being alone,

341
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:44,850
但是这是另外一种孤独
but this was a different kind of alone.

342
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:46,360
这是另外一种孤独
You know? This-this is a different kind of...

343
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,860
你们不是在看电影吗
I thought you two were watching a movie.

344
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,160
我们想举办一场芭比娃娃时装秀
We want to have a Barbie fashion show.

345
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,470
不错呀  听上去很好玩
Oh, cool. That sounds fun.

346
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,040
去玩芭比娃娃时装秀吧
So, go play Barbie fashion show.

347
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,260
我们想让你当明星评委
We need you to be the celebrity judge.

348
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,640
这样
Right.

349
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,590
但是我不行
Uh, the thing is I can't,

350
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,900
因为明天要排练了
because I got this rehearsal tomorrow

351
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,640
而且我很想脱稿  所以...
and I really want to be off book, so...

352
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,870
"脱稿"是什么意思
What does "Off book" mean?

353
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,510
脱稿  脱稿的意思就是
Off book. Off book means, uh,

354
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,760
意思就是我背下了台词
means that I know my lines.

355
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,530
让爷爷当评委好了
Have Grandpa be the judge.

356
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:10,440
爷爷不是明星呀
Grandpa's not a celebrity.

357
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:11,240
是呀
Yeah.

358
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:14,000
她们的逻辑挺合理的
Their logic seems sound.

359
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,880
谢谢你了
Thank you.

360
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:18,480
这样吧  你们想不想
Okay. Um... tell you what? You want to,

361
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,770
你们想帮帮我吗  想不想
you want to help me? You want to,

362
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:20,940
想不想和我一起念台词
you want to read the play with me?

363
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:22,120
-好呀  -来吧来吧
- Okay. - ?Yeah. Oh, come on.

364
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,090
-可以  -来吧来吧

365
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:24,220
来吧  来这边  威廉
Come on, over here. William,

366
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,020
-快来吧  -我可不是什么演员
- let's do it. - I'm not much of an actor.

367
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:26,600
这没关系
Oh, doesn't matter.

368
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,100
我只需要有人来念一下台词
I just need to get the lines down, so...

369
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,080
苔丝  从你开始
All right, Tess, we'll start with you.

370
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,240
你演杰西卡  大卫的妻子
Uh, you're gonna be Jessica, David's wife.

371
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:35,490
凭什么她可以演杰西卡
Why does she get to be Jessica?

372
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,270
因为你演格雷西
Oh, because you're Gracie, okay?

373
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:41,250
格雷西是杰西卡的妈妈  很酷
Gracie's Jessica's mom, which is kind of cool.

374
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,860
你可以对你姐姐颐指气使了
It means you get to boss your sister around.

375
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:43,820
怎么样  不错吧
How's that sound?

376
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:47,180
威廉  有很多问题
So. William, multiple questions.

377
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,460
第一个问题  老实说
First one, I'm not gonna lie to you,

378
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,780
-这问题有点微妙  -问吧
- it's a little delicate. - ?Go ahead.

379
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,070
你识字吗
Do you know how to read?

380
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:56,210
对  我识字
Yes, I can read.

381
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,620
我知道  我是跟你开玩笑呢
I knew it. I was joking.

382
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,870
你当然识字了
Of course you know how to read.

383
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,900
和你开玩笑呢
Trying to be funny. Okay.

384
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:05,290
你能不能念一下布拉德的台词
So if you could please read the role of Brad.

385
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,410
好极了  你去哪儿
Terrific, okay. Whoa, where we going?

386
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:09,540
我要尿尿
I have to pee.

387
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,730
我也要去尿尿
Oh, I kind of do, too.

388
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:14,530
你们怎么...我的天
What are you... Oh, good God.

389
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:37,090
这才像样嘛
Now, this is what I'm talking about.

390
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:38,640
宝贝  这样安排
Okay, babe, here's the plan.

391
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:39,960
先做爱
Sex first.

392
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,080
马上就做
Right away.

393
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,790
震耳欲聋  翻云覆雨
Loud, adult,

394
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,670
不用顾忌隔壁有小孩的那种
no kids in the next room sex.

395
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,910
而且不用来什么性爱马拉松
And it doesn't have to be marathon sex.

396
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:49,940
我们只要搞定这活
We just need to get the job done.

397
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:52,470
还有在看完《购房人》之前
And under no circumstances are we allowed

398
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,720
谁都不准先睡着
to fall asleep afterwards watching House Hunters.

399
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,620
不能整晚都浪费在睡觉上  对吧
Don't want to miss the whole night sleeping. Right?

400
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,650
我们要边淋浴边做
We'll do it in the shower.

401
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,570
超爽
That's good.

402
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,240
可别在豪华淋浴间睡着了
Won't fall asleep in the big fancy shower.

403
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:08,410
在此之前我们得先叫客房服务
And we'll order room service before.

404
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,630
这样一来  在结束成人式淋浴放荡性爱后
That way we will finish our loud adult shower sex

405
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:14,980
正好来客房服务  我们就可以穿着浴袍
just as room service arrives and we will slip on robes

406
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,870
啃汉堡  不  慢着  意大利面
and eat burgers... No, wait-- spaghetti.

407
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,150
不  我还是喜欢汉堡
No, I like burgers better.

408
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:21,820
我们要躺在床上啃汉堡
We will eat burgers in bed.

409
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:27,020
现在关键的问题是
Oh. Now, the big question is...

410
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,150
看什么付费节目好呢
what to order on pay-per-view.

411
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,310
我真希望他们这有
Oh, I already hope they, uh,

412
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:34,430
休·格兰特和梅丽尔·斯特里普的电影
I hope they have that Huge Grant-Meryl Streep movie that

413
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:36,800
这名字听着像个女黑人  瞧瞧
sounds like a black lady. Come on.

414
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,730
《跑调天后》
Florence Foster Jenkins.

415
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,750
宝贝  他们这有《跑调天后》
Baby, they already got Florence Foster Jenkins.

416
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:41,740
我月经迟了
I'm late.

417
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,910
迟了一周半  兰德尔
I'm a week and a half late, Randall,

418
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,550
我感觉糟透了
and I feel like crap.

419
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,460
昨天一整天我都在嚼冰
And I was chewing on ice all day yesterday

420
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,750
看到披萨的时候我差点吐了
and I almost threw up when I looked at pizza

421
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,600
而且我办不到自己一个人去药店
and I cannot bring myself to go to the drugstore

422
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,100
买验孕棒
and get a pregnancy test.

423
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,390
我彻底慌了  宝贝
I'm bugging out, baby.

424
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:08,350
你得让我冷静下来
I need you to talk me down.

425
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,540
-你好吗  -很好
- Hey, how are you? ?- Hey, good.

426
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,410

Come on in. We got carrots, celery,

427
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:17,440
西兰花  无蘸酱  不用客气
broccoli, no dip. You're welcome.

428
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:19,190
谢谢  真不错
Thank you, that's so nice.

429
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:21,680
凯特  这是我好朋友  舒特
Oh, and, uh, Kate, this is my good friend, Shooter.

430
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,880
舒特  这是凯特
Shooter, Kate.

431
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,670
很高兴认识你  凯特
Nice to finally meet you, Kate.

432
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,120

435
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,480
你怎么看  杰克
So, what do you think, Jack?

436
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:44,790
比赛马上就要进入第四节了
Looking like it's gonna come down to the fourth quarter.

437
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:53,720
你想现在谈吗  好吧  我们来谈
You want to do this now? Okay. Let's do it.

438
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:55,930
那么
So...

439
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,940
我对你来说还不够
I am not enough for you.

440
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,840
你有我还不够吗  杰克
Am I not enough for you, Jack?

441
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,470
-撤回吧台吗  -好的
- Okay, back to the bar? - Yep.

442
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:06,440
我从没这么说  我是说
I never said that. I just meant

443
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,450
这个问题我们总归是要谈的
we need to have this conversation at some point.

444
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:11,280
可你非要现在谈  在这青蛙酒吧
Okay. And you want to do that right now, at Froggy's

445
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,540
-超级碗直播的时候  -是啊
- during the Super Bowl? - Yes,

446
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,860
麻烦再大声点  别让我们错过你们的好戏
please don't make us miss a second of your drama.

447
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,080
你能别管闲事吗
Could you butt out?

448
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:22,710
宝贝  我们一直拿这事开玩笑
Babe, we joke about it.

449
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:24,710
我们看见别人带着孩子  就说
We see people with kids and go,

450
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,140
"谢天谢地  幸亏不是咱俩"
"Oh, thank God that's not us."

451
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:28,180
我们拿它开玩笑  不是吗
We joke about it. Right?

452
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:29,800
难道我理解错了吗
Did I not get the joke?

453
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,620
我不是...
I'm not...

454
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:33,090
宝贝  你是对的
Babe, you're right.

455
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,590
你是对的
You are right.

456
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:36,750
就我成长的家庭而言
And coming from the family that-that I did,

457
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,180
我从没想过要自己的孩子
I definitely never saw myself having kids.

458
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,580
-好的  -但后来我遇见了你
- Okay. ?- But then I met you.

459
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:45,220
而且  我们在一起很快乐
And, you know, we're j... we're great together

460
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:47,430
我喜欢我们的生活
and I love our life.

461
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:51,880
但随着年龄增长  我越发觉得...
But the older we get, the more I think that...

462
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,350
我越发觉得应该有超越你我两人
the more I think there's got to be something bigger

463
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:56,530
更有意义的事
than just me and you.

464
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,880
真是谢谢你把我加入
Well, thank you very much for involving me

465
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,750
你无形的巨大变化中  超巨大
in this huge invisible change of yours. Huge.

466
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:08,020
因为在你遇见我  直到娶了我
Because you knew when you met me and married me

467
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,890
就知道我不是那种
that I did not want to be one of those women

468
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,860
把成为母亲作为人生唯一目标的女人
whose sole purpose in life was to be a mother.

469
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:15,030
如果那是你想要的  你当初就该娶我妈
If that's what you wanted, you should have married my mom.

470
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:17,070
我更希望是你妹妹
I was thinking more your sister.

471
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,790
我估计也是
Oh. You probably were.

472
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:19,920
我只是...这玩笑不好笑
I'm... it's a bad joke.

473
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,710
我还没准备好  杰克
I'm not there yet, Jack.

474
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,380
我还没准备好
I'm not there yet.

475
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:26,960
-我才29  -快30了
- I am only 29. - ?Almost 30.

476
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,410
我知道自己几岁  
I know how old I am!

477
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:30,550
席德和南茜  你俩能出去吵吗
Hey, Sid and Nancy, will you two take it outside?

478
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,770
{\an8}《席德与南茜》1986年电影
传奇摇滚乐队吉他手席德与其女友南茜相爱相杀

479
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,800
-你能闭嘴不  -管好你自己的事
- Could you just shut up for a second? - Mind your business.

480
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,470
大伙都被你们吵得听不见球赛了
None of us can hear the game over your mouth.

481
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,170
你得学学礼貌了  老兄
You got to learn some manners, pal.

482
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:37,680
你得管好你的女人
You need to control your woman.

483
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,100
你说话小心点
You need to watch your mouth.

484
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:40,800
杰克  坐下
Jack, sit down.

485
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:42,830
回来  没必要吵
Come here. It's not worth it.

486
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:44,720
杰克  坐下  求你了
Jack, sit down, please.

487
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,390

-天啊  杰克  -杰克  杰克

是啊

我们真应该要孩子
we should really be having kids.

492
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:13,280
{\an8}药店

493
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,570
你不想说点什么吗
Aren't you gonna say anything?

494
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:29,340
好吧  这怎么可能
Uh, yeah. Like, how?

495
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:32,610
-你每天都有按时吃药吧  -没错
- You take the pill every day like clockwork, right? - Yeah.

496
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:34,590
还是我又不小心把哪粒药丢进我奶昔里了
What, did I accidentally drop one in my shake or something?

497
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,580
不  我...
No. I...

498
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:38,560
我上个月换了药
I mean, I changed medications last month

499
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,380
可能出现了短暂的排卵期
and there might have been, like, a brief window.

500
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,500
短暂的排卵期
A brief window?

501
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:43,580
抱歉
Sorry.

502
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,650
短暂的排卵期  贝丝
A brief window, Beth?

503
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:47,310
难道你没想过该跟你的丈夫
Did it not occur to you that that might be something

504
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:48,550
提这件事吗
you want to run by your husband?

505
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:50,090
我又不知道会出问题
Well, I didn't know it was gonna be a problem.

506
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:51,820
查尔斯顿泡汤了
Well, there goes Charleston.

507
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,340
抱歉  你说什么
Okay, I'm sorry, what?

508
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,440
十年之后  等女儿们都去上大学了
Ten years from now, when the girls are both off at college,

509
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,260
我想我们可以早些退休移居查尔斯顿
I thought that we would take an early retirement in Charleston.

510
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,540
不好意思  兰德尔
Oh, forgive me, Randall,

511
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,470
可你到底在说什么鬼
but what in the holy hell are you talking about?

512
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,860
你什么时候开始想搬去查尔斯顿了
Since when do you want to move to Charleston?

513
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:07,520
我看到电视上的介绍
I saw something about it on CNN.

514
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:10,310
在那可以享受高质量生活  高档餐厅
Like, they got a great quality of life, good restaurants.

515
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:14,620
工作闲暇时  我也会上网搜搜
Sometimes at work, I look up places on Zillow.

516
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,570
好吧  我真的非常抱歉
Oh, okay. Well, I'm so sorry that

517
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:21,130
让你最高机密的查尔斯顿之梦破碎了  宝贝
I'm screwing with your super top secret Charleston dream, honey.

518
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:23,710
我的问题和你的相比不值一提
No, my issues are nothing compared to yours.

519
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:24,850
-没人这么说  -等等  等等
- Nobody's saying that. - Wait,wait, wait, wait, wait,

520
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:25,810
来猜个谜语
here's a riddle--

521
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:28,730
是谁做好一切准备重返工作岗位
who has two hands and was about to go back to work full-time

522
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:31,850
这或许...或许能让她找回从前的自己
and maybe, maybe... start to remember who she was?

523
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:32,700
好吗
Yeah?

524
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,230
可现在她只能把时间花在
But now will have to split her time between

525
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:37,720
换尿布台和家庭办公室了
a diaper station and a home office?

526
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,980
这女人  就在此
This girl, right here.

527
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,840
-是两根拇指  -什么
- It's two thumbs. - ?What?

528
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,870
你姿势不对
You're doing it wrong.

529

That is a vivid picture.

535

就像在现场看一样
I feel like I'm at the game.

536
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,310
跑过了赛场
Over across the field, here.

537
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:04,840
这电视是挺不错
Yeah. It's a really nice TV...

00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:12,560
托比

-凯特  凉薯  -什么

Is that a vegetable or a fruit?

549
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,220
能挪个地儿吗  小托
Can... can you actually just move, Tob?

550
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:27,400
好好好
Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yep.

551
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,830
外接手到位了
The receiver's all set.

00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:32,070
往右  本看着中间
To the right, Ben looks straight over the middle,

553
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,310
跑向达阵区
and going for the end zone!

554
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,060
舒特  跟凯特说说
Shooter, uh, tell Kate

555
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,660
那次我们误打误撞
about that time we accidentally

556
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,820
去听了艾希莉·辛普森演唱会的事
went to an Ashlee Simpson concert.

557
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,160
真得跟你说说
Uh, you got to hear this.

558
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,270
-我们当时是想...  -不好意思
- So, we were trying to... - I'm sorry.

559
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:44,730
托比  你按了暂停
Toby, you paused the TV.

560
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:45,820
就这样暂停了
It's like, paused.

561
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,260
是啊  就一会儿  你听他说
Yeah, just for a second. Listen to this.

562
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:47,880
真的值得一听
No, this is a great story.

563
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,770
不  好吧
No. O-Okay,

564
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,650
其实没什么
I know it's not a big deal, really,

565
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:53,350
只不过我比较喜欢
but I kind of like to watch sports

566
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:54,440
看球赛直播
as they happen live.

567
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:55,720
可能只有我这样吧
Probably just me, right?

568
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,770
-我不知道  -好  好  我们继续
- I don't know. - Okay. Okay. Here we go.

触地得分
Touch down!

572
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,460
海沃德全程自己一个人从左侧突围...
And Heyward made it all alone down the left side...

573
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,840
厉害  你喜欢的球队是吧
That's great. That's your team, right?

574
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,020
我心中的梦之队
That's my fantasy team.

575
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,370
-那是什么  -跟你们说
- What's that? - ?You know what,

576
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,530
抱歉打断一下
I'm so sorry to interrupt,

577
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:12,080
我不太舒服
I'm actually not feeling good.

578
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:12,950
我得先走了
I'm gonna go ahead and go.

579
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:13,740
不会吧
Oh, no!

580
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:15,410
真的要走了吗
Are you sure?

581
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:16,780
凯特  留下吧
No, Kate, stay.

582
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:17,680
舒特
Shooter...

583
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,570
-很高兴见到你  -很高兴见到你
- It was really nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

584
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:20,560
-什么  等等  -认真的
- What... wait, wait, wait. - Seriously,

585
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,920
-谢谢你做了凉薯  -什么
- thank you for the jicama. - ?What...

586
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,940
晚点再聊
I'll talk to you later.

587
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,700
怎么了
What is happening?

588
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,220
你得放下她  大卫
You have to let her go, David.

589
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,230
这样太不理智了
This is crazy, man.

590
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,460
她走了  不会再回来了
She's gone and she's never coming back.

591
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,290
你之前真的没演过戏吗
You really never acted before?

592
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:35,100
没
Nope.

593
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:36,920
丝绸一般的嗓音
Voice like silk.

594
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,590
我怎么放得下  大卫
How am I supposed to move on, David?

595
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,940
不对  我是大卫
No. I'm David.

596
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,890
我怎么放得下  布拉德
How am I supposed to move on, Brad?

597
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,800
你凭什么劝我放下
And who made you the expert of moving on?

598
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,660
你凭什么说我
Or the expert of anything for that matter?

599
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,300
你打算就这么演吗
Is that how you're gonna do it?

600
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:56,080
不是
No.

601
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,480
那就好
Good.

602
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,790
到你了
It's your line.

603
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:01,070
苔丝  亲爱的  下一句是你了
Tess, honey, you have the next line.

604
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:01,770
集中注意力
Pay attention.

605
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:04,660
我...我不希望你放下
?I-I'd rather you not move on. I'm--

606
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:07,850
我...我显然没这打算
I'm obv-- I'm obviously not planning to.

607
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:08,840
不好
It's not good.

608
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,170
没你想的那么容易是吧
Not as easy as it looks, is it?

609
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:11,830
-是的  -是吧  好
- No. - ?No. Okay.

610
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,320
她在那  你看见她了吗
There she is! Do you see her?

611
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,800
谁  大卫吗  我看到谁了
Who, David? Did I see who?

612
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,220
她啊  她就在那
Her! She's right there.

613
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:16,900
在她死后
And ever since she died,

614
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,470
她的鬼魂就一直跟着我
her ghost has been haunting me.

615
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:19,560
等等
Hold up.

616
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:21,860
怎么了  亲爱的
What's the matter, sweetheart?

617
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:24,090
这是个什么故事
What's happening in this story?

618
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:26,150
你没懂这个故事吗
You're not following the story?

619
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,160
你懂了吗
Do you follow it?

620
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:32,220
当然  我当然懂
Of course. Yes, of course I follow it.

621
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:34,510
她死了是吧
She died, right?

622
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:35,380
她死了
She's dead.

623
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:37,680
但她的鬼魂一直阴魂不散
But she keeps coming back as a ghost.

624
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,990
所以你死后就会变成鬼吗
So when you die you become a ghost?

625
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,190
不会
No.

626
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,870
不不不  亲爱的  鬼都是假的
No, no, no, no, no. No. Sweetheart, ghosts aren't real.

627
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:46,710
那你死了之后会发生什么
So what happens when you die?

628
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:52,330
你死了之后会发生什么
What happens when you die?

629
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:54,710
你就死了
Uh, is... you die.

630
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,570
永远吗
Forever?

631
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,320
是的  也可能不是
Sure... or not.

632
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,220
我不知道  亲爱的  是这样的
I don't know. Honey, here's the thing, you know,

633
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,570
你想不想要鬼  我可以...
do we want ghosts or do we not want ghosts? Because I can...

634
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:07,370
爷爷因为生病了总吃药
Grandpa takes pills because he's sick,

635
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,000
爷爷会死吗
is Grandpa gonna die?

636
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:11,460
为什么要问我
Why are you asking me this?

637
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,520
会吧  会
Yes? Yes.

638
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,000
快了吗
Soon?

639
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:17,560
跟你们说
Well, you know, I mean,

640
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,920
我是你的话就不会投入太多感情...
I wouldn't get too attached if I were you, so...

641
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:21,840
不  不不不
No! No, no, no.

642
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,580
我不是这个意思  我话是这么说
That's not what I meant. Look, I-I mean, I meant it,

643
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,160
但我只是想活跃气氛  是个笑话  好吗
but I was trying to be fun... It was a joke, okay?

644
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:27,030
死亡是一件很自然的事
Here's the thing about death, is that it's natural.

645
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:30,600
是自然规律  我也会死  明白吗
It's just natural. I'm gonna die, okay?

646
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,330
你们俩  你们也会死
You two? You're gonna die.

647
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,230
爸爸妈妈也会死
Mommy and Daddy are gonna die.

648
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:37,220
-爸爸妈妈会死吗  -不是...
- Mommy and Daddy are gonna die? - No. Uh...

649
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:39,400
听着...我的天  时间不早了
Look, uh, oh, my gosh, Wil... it is getting late.

650
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,670
要睡觉了  孩子们
It's bedtime, girls.

651
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:41,830
-来吧  孩子们  -对的
- Come on, girls. - Yep.

652
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,770

00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:45,820
谢谢你们帮我
Thanks for all the help.

654
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,290
别忘了刷牙
Don't forget to brush your teeth.

655
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:59,200
你们什么时候决定要小孩的
Wh-when did you guys know you wanted kids?

656
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:05,160
大概是在她第一次怀孕的四个月后
Uh, about, uh, four months into her first pregnancy.

657
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:12,320
丽贝卡觉得如果我们有了小孩
Rebecca thinks that if we have kids,

658
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:13,660
我们的生活就完了
our lives are gonna be over.

659
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:15,980
她说得对  哥们
She's right, pal. Yeah.

660
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,060
她说得对
She's totally right.

661
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,770
那时你们可以跟生活说再见了
You can kiss this life good-bye.

662
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:27,360
如果她不想要小孩呢
What if she doesn't want kids?

663
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,430
这真的有那么重要  不惜闹僵吗
Is that really like a, like a deal-breaker?

664
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:44,520
我去找雪莉
I got to go find Shelly.

665
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,720
被人给截球了
That over the wrong shoulder.

666
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,980
这是有史以来最精彩的一次接球
That's one of the great catches you'll ever see.

667

近67米

668

00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:09,430
就要诞生了
throughout the Rose Bowl.

670
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,090
谁是最佳球队已毋庸置疑
Not much doubt about the best team.

这可不是我今晚的计划
This isn't the night I had planned.

00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,050
我知道
I know.

Shall we look?

679
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,090
等等  我们...
Wait. Just, um, let's... let's...

好
Okay.

00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,790
你仍然可以接更多工作

683
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,540
我可以减少工作量
I can work less.

684
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:06,080
我们可以找个保姆
We'll get a nanny.

或者"靓男保姆"
Or a manny.

00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:07,870
天啊  不要
God, no.

-什么度假屋  你可以...  -不要了

689
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,960
太麻烦了
It's too much trouble.

690
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,770
要担心飓风
Worrying about hurricanes

691
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:22,270
还要担心会不会有小孩闯进来
and whether or not it gets broken into by some kids

692
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:24,740
用来...  谁知道干嘛呢
using it for their who knows what?

693
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:27,570
南卡罗莱纳州的小混混们
Damn South Carolina punk-ass kids.

694
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:37,830
有个儿子应该不会太糟
You know, a son wouldn't totally suck.

695
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,730
我们生的孩子都很棒
We do make good kids.

696
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:45,390
是啊  都很棒
That we do, that we do.

姑娘们会喜欢的
The girls will love it.

698
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,900
她们会乐疯的
Oh, they'll go nuts.

699
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:57,570
是谁有两根拇指
What has two thumbs

700
00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:00,080
还如此地深爱着自己的妻子
and loves his wife so much it hurts?

701
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:04,840
说"两根拇指"确实好一些
Oh, it does work better with two thumbs.

702
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,120
不  我还是喜欢你的方式
Nah. I like the way you do it.

703
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,650
这样啊...  那我喜欢你的表情
Mm. Well... I like your face.

704
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,440
要看看吗
Shall we do this?

705
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:30,870
刚才的交流脱离控制了  对吧
Well, that conversation went sideways, didn't it?

706
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,240
兰德尔知道了一定会揍我的
Randall's gonna punch me for that conversation.

707

我得去和孩子们谈谈
I got to go talk to the girls.

708
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:38,930
和孩子们谈谈...  我应该说什么呢
Go talk to the girls-- what am I gonna say?

709
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,970
我显然不是那个
You know, I am clearly not the man

710
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:42,060
能够和她们讨论
that needs to be talking to them

711
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,940
这些生死之类的复杂话题的人
about the intricacies of life and death.

712
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:44,720
这实在...
It's...

713
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,900
你总是这样
You do that a lot.

714
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,630
我总是怎么样
I do what a lot?

715

怀疑自己
Doubt yourself.

716
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:03,100
你演得很好  凯文
You were very good, Kevin.

00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:05,120
在那个剧里
On that show.

718
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,640
你看了《靓男保姆》吗
You watched The Manny?

719
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:13,170
来这里之前  有台旧电视机
Before I came here, I had one old television,

720

只有三个台能看

我当时想  这人真有才啊
And I remember thinking, he's very talented.

723
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:23,810
我喜欢你失去宝宝的那集
I liked the one where you lose the baby.

724
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:24,880
天啊
Oh, geez.

725
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,160
《男保姆发火》

728
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,820
-没错  -是啊
- Yeah. ?- Yeah, yeah.

729
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:36,620
我真不该退出那部剧
I never should have left that show.

730
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:37,520
我...
I've...

731
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,140
我不该来这里的  毫无疑问
I never should have come here, that's for sure.

732
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,270
过来照顾侄女  演什么戏剧...
Being an uncle, right, doing theater...

733
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:44,260
我...
I... I...

734
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:47,490
我根本不是演戏剧的料
I'm not cut out for theater.

735
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:49,270
你又开始了
And there you go again.

736
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:53,400
好吧  你说起来容易啊  对吧
Well, yeah, I mean, that's easy for you to say, right?

737
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,590
你就是皮克斯动画片里那只聪明的猫头鹰
You're the wise owl in a Pixar film.

738
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,700
而我是那只愚蠢的拉布拉多犬
I'm the dopey Labrador.

739
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,960
我是离死不远的戒了毒的瘾君子
I'm a dying recovering addict.

740
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,060
-随你说了  -聪明的猫头鹰说了
- Yeah, whatever. - ?Yeah, well, people love Labradors.

人们都喜欢拉布拉多
Said the wise owl.

742
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,840
你知道是怎么回事吗
You want to know what it is?

743
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,230
在这部戏里
It's this play, right?

744
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,330
和我一起工作的那些人
I mean, these people that I'm working with,

745
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:20,460
他们简直比我聪明一个级别
wow, they're like next level smart.

746
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,870
我是说  他们太优秀了
I mean, uh, they're brilliant.

747
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,420
他们看我的眼神就好像  我是个笑话
And then they look at me like I'm a joke, right?

748
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:26,110
搞得我都怀疑自己是个笑话
Which makes me start to think that I am a joke,

749
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,870
然后我就开始失去方向
and then I start spinning.

750
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:30,060
我甚至再也搞不清这部戏在讲什么
I don't even know what the play's about anymore.

751
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:33,150
凯文  你最初读剧本时觉得是讲什么的
Kevin, what did you think it was about when you first read it?

752
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:42,360
这不重...  这不重要  这实在...
You know, it doesn't ma-- it doesn't matter, it's...

753
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,700
你想说这太傻了
You're just gonna think it's stupid.

754
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:59,080
{\an8}青蛙酒吧

755
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,840
愚蠢的拉布拉多说的
Said the dopey Labrador.

756
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:04,500
我们胜利了
We did it!

757
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:11,970
如果要在你和生孩子之间做选择  我选你
If it's between you and having kids, you win.

758
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,450
每次如此
Every time.

759
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:16,000
毫无疑问
No question.

760
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,430
我爸爸
My father,

761
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,630
他爱橄榄球胜过一切
he loved football more than anything.

762
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:33,130
大多时候  他根本
Most of the time, he-he pretty much

763
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:35,010
就不怎么理我
didn't want anything to do with me.

764
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:39,530
可是...  如果他在看球赛
But... if he was watching football,

765
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:41,120
他会让我坐好
he let me sit

766
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:43,360
和他一起看球赛
and watch the game with him.

767
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,840
每当我坐在地板上时
As long as I'd sit on the floor

768
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,350
我几乎一言不发
and I didn't talk too much.

769
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:58,620
我总是在想  以后我有了孩子
I always imagined that when I had kids

770
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:01,930
我也会和他们一起看球赛
that I'd watch the games with them, too.

771
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:06,770
但是我会让他们说话
Except I-I'd let them talk...

772
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:10,280
想说多大声都行
as loud as they wanted.

773
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,060
我不知道自己是怎么了
I don't know what's wrong with me.

774
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,940
你一点问题也没有  小贝
God, there's nothing wrong with you, Bec.

775
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,390
和我同龄的朋友都有孩子了
All of my friends my age have kids.

776
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,070
每一个都有了
Every single one of them.

777
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:27,670
可是...
And...

778
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:31,840
也许是因为我还在青蛙酒吧唱歌
maybe it's 'cause I'm still singing at Froggy's

779
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,080
而且我觉得我还不够格做父母
and I'm not as far along as I thought I would be.

780
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,110
我不知道
I don't know.

781
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,130
事实就是  每当我闭上眼
'Cause the truth is, when I close my eyes

782
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:41,190
想象我们的未来...
and I think about our future...

783
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:46,290
我看见我们在带孩子  杰克
I see us with kids, Jack.

784
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:47,940
是啊
Yeah.

785
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:51,280
我就是...

我喜欢我们的生活
I love our life.

787
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:57,800
就喜欢现在的生活
I love it right now.

788
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:03,220
我很怕会有改变
And I'm so scared of changing it.

789
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,340
我不会去改变我们的生活
I don't want to change it.

790
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,880
好吗  我无法容忍我们之间有任何改变
Okay? I'm not gonna stand for anything changing between us.

791
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,600
我们之间的感情  就你和我
Okay? What we have together, you and me.

792
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:13,730
什么都不会改变
Nothing.

793
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:22,040
我很抱歉整天给你压力
Look, I'm sorry about pressuring you all day.

794
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:23,780
我只是...
I just...

795
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,900
我只想要你
I just want you.

796
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,970
钢人队赢了超级杯

那么
So, uh...

我说了  我想自己看比赛
I told you I wanted to watch the game by myself.

807

那你为什么同意过来
Then why did you agree to come over?

808
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:34,650
不知道
I don't know.

809
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:35,780
因为我不想

Okay. What's it about then?

815
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,140

直到我长大了
until I grew up and...

819
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:03,130
搬来这里  就没了这个习惯
I moved out here and I just got out of the habit.

直到2006年  美国橄榄球联盟冠军赛
It wasn't until the 2006 AFC Championship

821
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:08,010

Yeah.

836
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:42,810
好吧
Okay.

837
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:45,050
好吧
Um... ?All right.

838
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:48,320
我知道这有点瘆人
And I know it's gonna be a little creepy.

839
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:53,880
这是你爸吗
This is your dad?

840
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:00,230
杰克
Jack.

841
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:07,600
我知道这听起来很扯很逊
I know it sounds crazy and lame,

842
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:13,150
但我们家很重视橄榄球  特别重视
but football is a really big part of my family. Like, really big.

843
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:15,340
如果不是因为橄榄球  我都不会出生
Like, I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for football.

844
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,580
我妈是超级碗比赛时  在卫生间怀上了我
I was conceived in a bathroom during the Super Bowl.

845
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:36,830
抱歉我之前态度不好
Sorry if I was a jerk before.

846
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:43,860
你们真不打算原谅我吗
You're really not gonna forgive me?

847
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:47,010
好吧
Okay.

848
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,960
那如果我告诉你们
What if I told you a-a secret

849
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,300
一个我从没跟人说过的秘密呢
that I've never shared with anyone before?

850
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:56,890
说说看吧
We're listening.

851
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:58,280
好  行
Okay. All right.

852
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,270
但你们得保证不告诉别人
But you got to promise not to tell anyone though, okay?

853
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:02,430
我要说的事很私密
This is a very private thing that I'm sharing with you.

854
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:04,940
是你和黛米·洛瓦托[歌手]交往的事吗
Is this about you dating Demi Lovato?

855
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,330
因为大家都知道这事
Because everyone knows.

856
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:08,750
不是  不是黛米·洛瓦托的事
No. You know what, it's not about Demi Lovato,

857
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:11,000
而且我跟她只是普通朋友  我...
and we were just friends. I just...

858
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:16,520
我有时候会画画
Sometimes I... paint.

859
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,540
谁都不知道这事  你凯特姑姑也不知道
Now, no one knows this, not even your Aunt Kate,

860
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,930
我拿到剧本时
but... when I get a script,

861
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:25,200
第一件事就是把自己的感觉画出来
the first thing I do is just sort of paint the way it makes me feel.

862
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:36,650
我第一次读了那个剧本后  就画了这幅画
I painted this after I read that play for the first time.

863
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:37,690
给
So...

864
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:48,860
我想我以前吓过你们
I think I scared you before.

865
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:53,020
讲什么鬼故事啊  死亡啊
Um, all that talk of ghosts and dying.

866
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,470
所有大人读过的故事
All that adult stuff we were reading about.

867
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:56,780
一些成让人困惑的大人事情
That's some pretty confusing adult stuff.

868
00:37:57,490 --> 00:37:59,980
所以
So, uh, you know,

869
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:02,190
我以为我过来给你们看我的画
I thought I would come up here, show you my painting,

870
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,450
说一下我演那部戏的主题
tell you what I think my play is about.

871
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:07,140
因为我在想
Because I was thinking, um,

872
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,960
这会让我们都好受些
that it might make us all feel a little bit better.

873
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,150
但你们不能笑我  好吗
But you got to promise not to make fun of me, okay?

874
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,380
那么
So, um...

875
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,100
我画了这幅是因为我觉得这部剧的主旨是生活
Yeah, I painted this because I felt like the play was about life, you know?

876
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,930
生活充满了色彩
And life is full of color.

877
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,390
每个人一路走来
And we each get to come along

878
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:29,740
为生活带来了自己的颜色
and we add our own color to the painting.

879
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:33,510
尽管这幅画不是什么神作
You know? And even though it's not very big, the painting,

880
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,210
你得琢磨出让线条持续下午
you sort of have to figure that it goes on forever,

881
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:38,340
每个方向都无限延伸下去
you know, in each direction. So, like, to infinity, you know?

882
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:40,320
因为这就是生活  对吧
'Cause that's kind of like life, right?

883
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,090
仔细想想  其实很不可思议
And it's really crazy, if you think about it, isn't it,

884
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:43,860
一百年前
that, a hundred years ago,

885
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:48,380
一个我素未谋面的人带着行李箱来到这个国家
some guy that I never met came to this country with a suitcase.

886
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:56,820
他有一个儿子
He has a son,

887
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:58,830
儿子又有儿子
who has a son,

888
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:01,920
儿子的儿子又有儿子  就是我
who has me.

889
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,280
所以我一开始画的时候
So, at first, when I was painting,

890
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,680
我当时想  也学在这里
I was thinking, you know, maybe up here,

891
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,840
画中这里是这个人的起点
that was that guy's part of the painting and then, you know,

892
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:10,090
而我就在画的这里
down here, that's my part of the painting.

893
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,190
然后我开始思考  如果...
And then I started to think, well, what if...

894
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,250
如果我们都在画布上呢
we're all in the painting, everywhere?

895
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,820
{\an8}三个小家伙

896
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,360
如果我们出生前  命运就已经被画好了呢
And-and what if we're in the painting before we're born?

897
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:20,680
{\an8}三个小家伙

898
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:20,520
如果我们死后才会出现在画上呢
What if we're in it after we die?

899
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:21,920
{\an8}三个小家伙

900
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,490
我们添加的这些颜色
And these colors that we keep adding,

901
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:27,510
如果都只是相互间颜色的叠加呢
what if they just keep getting added on top of one another,

902
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:31,780
直到最后我们都变成了同样的颜色呢
until eventually we're not even different colors anymore?

903
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:34,550
我们都只是一体的
We're just... one thing.

904
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:36,270
一幅画
One painting.

905
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,010
-幸运帽  -幸运帽
- Lucky cap. - ?Lucky cap.

906
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:50,200
我爸不在我们身边了
I mean, my dad is not with us anymore.

907
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:53,010
他去世了  但他活在我们心里
He's not alive, but he's with us.

908
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:59,290
{\an8}未怀孕

909
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,880
每天都活在我心里
He's with me every day.

910
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:01,600
一切都冥冥中自有安排
It all just sort of fits somehow.

911
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,090
即便你现在还不知道何时何地
And even if you don't understand how yet,

912
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:08,630
我们爱的人终将会离世
people will die in our lives, people that we love.

913
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:10,040
也许在未来
In the future.

914
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,770
也许在明天
Maybe tomorrow.

915
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:13,350
也许几年后
Maybe years from now.

916
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:15,170
其实挺美好的
I mean, it's kind of beautiful, right,

917
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:17,270
如果仔细想想  就算一个人死了
if you think about it, the fact that just because someone dies,

918
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:18,360
就算你见不到这些人
just because you can't see them

919
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,990
不能再和他们说话
or talk to them anymore,

920
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,040
不代表画中没有他们的位置
it doesn't mean they're not still in the painting.

921
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,620
我想也许这就是全部的意义所在
I think maybe that's the point of the whole thing.

922
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:29,410
没有死亡
There's no dying.

923
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:33,830
没有单独的你或我  或者他们
There's no you or me or them.

924
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:35,970
我们都是一体的
It's just us.

925
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:50,830
这幅...凌乱的
And this... sloppy...

926
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:54,110
狂野的  色彩缤纷的奇妙之画
wild, colorful, magical thing

927
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:56,220
没有起点  也没有终点
that has no beginning, it has no end...

928
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,060
这幅画
this right here...

929
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,130
这就是我们
I think it's us.

Previously on This Is Us...

00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:07,990
-什么  -也许我们该奋斗各自的事业了
- What? - I think it's time we go at it alone for a while.

4
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:09,440
就一段时间  看结果如何
You know? See what happens.

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,700
抱歉  我的剧本上没写有停顿...
This doesn't say "Pause" on my script.

6
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,310
上面也没写烂呢  再看现在这个效果
Well, it doesn't say "suck" either, yet here we are.

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,910
我根本不是演戏剧的料
I'm not cut out for theater.

8
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:17,540
你总是这样  怀疑自己
You do that a lot-- doubt yourself.

9
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:20,580
你们一直忙着不让凯特吃得太多
You're so busy making sure that Kate's not eating too much...

10
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:21,220
凯文  冷静一下
Kev, calm down.

11
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,420
总怕兰德尔觉得自己是被领养的
...and Randall's not too adopted!

12
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,450
对不起  我本该在你身边的  以后改正
I'm sorry. I should have been there, and I'm gonna be there.

13
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,120
我儿子平时放学后
Do you think that my son could play with

14
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,110
-能跟你家小孩一起玩吗  -当然
- yours sometime after school? - Yeah.

15
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:32,370
每次我新认识一个黑人
Every time I met a new black person,

16
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:34,920
就在那个小本本上标记一下
I would put a mark in this notebook,

17
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:36,830
每次遇见一个黑人男子
and every time I met a black man,

18
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:39,960
我就会想他会不会是我亲生父亲
I wondered if that man could possibly be my father.

19
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:14,400
不行  宝贝  要先吃完香蕉
No, baby, you got to finish your bananas first.

20
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,940
想吃香蕉吗  小凯  吃香蕉吗
You want some banana? Kev, you want a little banana, too?

21
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,770
吃完就可以去找爸爸玩了  再吃点
Go in and see your daddy right now, okay? You have some more.

22
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:21,260
-杰克  牛奶好像没了  -好
- Jack, I think we're completely out of milk. - Yeah.

23
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,550
-他就是不喝果汁  -行  我...
- He won't drink his juice. - Yeah, I'll, um...

24
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:24,100
-就想喝牛奶  -我下次带点回来
- He just wants milk. - I'll bring some home.

要再吃点苹果吗  来吧
Do you want some more apples? Come on.

来  吃饱了要不要下来  好的
Come on. Here, do you want to get out of your chair? Yeah.

27
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,070
来吧
All right. Come on.

28
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,210
亲爱的  你要去做文职
Babe, a desk job?

29
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:33,450
小贝  我们需要这份工资
Bec, we need the money.

30
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,120
你连领带都没有
You don't even own a tie.

你听说了吗
did you hear?

34
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,730

Uh... yeah.

Surprise birthday cake for Sandra in the break room.

36

其实根本算不上什么惊喜
You know, it's never, it's never a surprise.

37

Okay, also,

I got promoted.

-太好了  恭喜你  -谢谢
- That's great, man. Hey. - Thanks.

00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,850
我想带你一起
And I'm bringing you with me.

42
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:24,160
这个...
Oh. Um...

43
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,450
谢谢你  不过算了
thanks, but no.

44
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,340
-还是谢谢你  -怎么算了
- But thanks. - No?

45
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,510
你先别声张
Keep this quiet,

46
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:31,870
我准备自己出去闯
but I'm, uh, gonna go out on my own.

47
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,670
想自己创业
I want to start my own thing.

48
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,860
我知道很冒险  但是只要事业步入正轨
I know it's risky, but once I get things up and running,

49
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,710
我就能有更多时间陪孩子们了
I can spend more time with my kids.

50
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,380
好吧  要不这样  先别急着拒绝
All right, how 'bout this: why don't you, um,

51
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:43,810
花几天时间考虑一下
take till the end of the week,

52
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,520
-周末再答复我  -真的不用了
- think about it. - I'm okay.

53
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,110
我不需要考虑
Don't need to think.

54
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,850
周末再说  好吗
End of the week, okay?

55
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,650

冰淇淋  冰淇淋
Ice cream? Ice cream?!

00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,530
又不是给我买的  不然你下次就抱不动我了
None for me if you want to be able to pick me up again.

69
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:24,740
瞎说  你这么瘦
Please, you are tiny.

70
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,810
-就你嘴甜  -不过你答应买冰淇淋
- Right. Mm. - But ice cream must mean that the kids'

71
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:29,310
-是不是因为孩子们成绩挺好  -没有
- report cards came back and they were good? - No.

72
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,390
基本都是B和C  我没辙了
Actually, mostly B's and C's. I caved.

73
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,360
不知道该怎么办  我额叶都疼了
I don't know. Parenting makes my cerebellum hurt.

74
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,450
你的什么
Sorry, your what?

75
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:38,490
就是我的大脑中控制情绪的部分
It's the part of my brain that makes my emotions.

76
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:41,460
我做了太多三年级的科学作业了
I have been doing way too much third grade science homework.

77
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,820
不过你还是看看这个吧
But why don't you, uh, look at that.

78
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,310
兰德尔的老师为什么想见我们
Why does Randall's teacher want to see us?

79
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:51,390
不知道
I don't know.

80
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,680
好吧
Okay.

81
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,310
*你如此美丽*
*You are too beautiful*

82
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,860
*亲爱的  我想对你说*
*My dear, to be true*

83
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:03,830
*我如此愚钝*
*For one lucky fool*

84
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:05,890
*配不上你*
*To be with*

85
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:09,200
*你太过美丽*
*You are too beautiful*

86
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,410
*我如此愚钝*
*And I am a fool*

87
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:16,900
*却爱慕着你*
*For beauty*

88
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,870
恕我冒昧  如果太久不弹  钢琴会很孤单
Hope you don't mind. Pianos get forlorn if you don't play 'em.

89
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,720
不  我完全不介意
No, of course I don't mind.

90
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,840
-你怎么学会弹钢琴的  -我爸教我的
- Where'd you learn how to play like that? - My dad taught me.

91
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,110
我爸是他爸教的
And his dad taught him.

92
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:32,060
爸爸  你能教我们弹琴吗
Dad, can you teach us to play?

93
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,080
我也很想教
I wish I could.

94
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,060
可家里的音乐细胞都被奶奶和凯特姑姑占了
Grandma and Aunt Kate got all the music talent in the family.

95
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,980
我一向都只有肌肉发达
Me? I was always all knuckles.

96
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,380
你爸比较擅长其他方面
Yeah, well, your dad's got other skills.

97
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,440
以前我还能靠这个本事
Me, I managed to squeak out a couple of dollars

98
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,990
混几口饭吃
on one of these back in the day.

99
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,940
主要是吹小号  什么表演我都参加
Mostly trumpet, mm. Any gigs I could get.

100
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,350
你能不能来参加学校的职业日
Will you speak at my career day?

101
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,130
职业日能不能叫爷爷去
Can Grandpa speak at my career day?

102
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:52,680
我想不行  宝贝儿
I don't think so, baby.

103
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:54,840
只能一个人发言  我已经报名了
You're only allowed one speaker, and I'm already signed up.

104
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,070
我想让爷爷讲
I pick Grandpa.

105
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,560
他的工作很酷
He had a cool job.

106
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,790
你是说老爸的工作就不酷了吗
What are you saying, that Daddy doesn't have a cool job?

107
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,840
你们很喜欢到办公室找我玩  不是吗
But you guys love visiting me at the office, right?

108
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,250
我喜欢坐在你的椅子上转圈
I like spinning in your chair.

109
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,380
其实你的工作有点无聊  爸爸
You kind of have a boring job, Dad.

110
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:13,150
基于长期气候模式的商品期货交易
Trading commodity futures based on long-term weather patterns

111
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:14,700
才不会无聊  好吗
is not boring, okay?

112
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:18,670
抱歉
Sorry,

113
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:21,040
一听"商品"这个词我就有点犯困
sort of fell asleep soon as I heard the word "commodity."

114
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,340
凯文叔叔  你能在我的职业日上发言吗
Uncle Kevin, can you speak at my career day?

115
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,960
老爸会负责职业日  讨论到此结束
Daddy's doing career day! End of discussion.

116
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,220
我的发言会很"燃"的
And it's gonna be lit.

117
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,700
"燃"这个字不是这么用的  对吧
That's not how you use "lit," right?

118
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:35,120
对
No.

119
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,730
对不起  我不明白
Sorry, I don't understand.

120
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:40,630
你们是说兰德尔很有天分吗
So you are saying that Randall is gifted?

121
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,880
可他成绩很一般啊
But his grades are average.

122
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,690
你确定给他做的测试没问题吗
Are you sure you tested him right?

123
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:46,190
杰克  我们知道他有多聪明
Jack, we know how smart he is.

124
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,790
那他的成绩是怎么回事
Okay, so what's up with his grades?

125
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:50,550
也许是...  老师对他有偏见
M-Maybe is the-the teacher prejudiced?

126
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,700
-杰克  -不可能
- Jack. - No.

127
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,860
如果孩子在测试中表现良好
When a child tests well

128
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,120
成绩却反映不出来
but his grades don't seem to reflect it,

129
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,920
通常是他所在的学校没有足够的挑战
oftentimes, he isn't being challenged at his school.

130
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:01,920
或许你们可以考虑其他选择
And you maybe want to consider other options.

131
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,710
{\an8}海恩斯学院
招收超常儿童

132
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,710
他们对兰德尔这类特殊儿童
They have wonderful programs

133
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:06,040
由一套出色的学习方案
for exceptional children like Randall.

134
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:06,940
绝对不行
Not gonna happen.

135
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:09,620
杰克  你能不能冷静点
Jack, please stop making me say "Jack."

136
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,120
虽然兰德尔在的这所学校只有几个黑人孩子
Randall is one of the only black kids at this school,

137
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:14,530
可他在这儿至少还有兄弟姐妹
but at least here he has his brother and sister.

138
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:15,740
-我明白  -那另外两个孩子呢
- I know. - What about them?

139
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,280
他们也能去那所学校吗
I mean, can they go, too?

140
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,870
皮尔森先生  恕我冒昧
Mr. Pearson, all due respect,

141
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,790
凯文和凯特过去是没什么好处的
Kevin and Kate wouldn't do well in that school.

142
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,720
看到没  这就是你们犯的错误
You see, that's where you're wrong.

143
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:27,470
我们的三个孩子都很出众
All of our children are exceptional.

144
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:30,850
我能摸摸你吗
Can I touch you?

145
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,810
我只想再触摸你一次
I just want to touch you one more time.

146
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,650
哪怕...  只是你身体的一部分
Just... one part of your body.

147
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:36,590
你的头发
Your hair.

148
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,100
我想清醒过来
I want to wake up...

149
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,140
对不起  我...  我...
I'm sorry, I... I'm...

150
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:44,800
我不能...
I'm not...

151
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,680
对不起  可以重来一遍吗
I'm sorry, can we... can we just start over?

152
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,030
好的  凯文  能问你个问题吗
Yeah, yeah. Uh, Kevin, can I ask you something?

153
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,070
当然
Yeah.

154
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,050
为什么...
Why...

155
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,330
你能不能试着给我解释一下
Just try to help me understand this.

156
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:59,130
为什么每到这个场景
Wh-Why, every time we come to this scene,

157
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:03,890
这场戏悲伤到极点  本应该...
this-this pinnacle of grief, which should rip...

158
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:08,280
我是说  你本该让观众们痛哭流涕
I mean, literally rip... tears from the audience,

159
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:14,660
你语气怎么像谷歌地图的语音一样毫无感情呢
why you summon up all the emotion of a Google Maps voice.

160
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:18,290
好吧
Right.

161
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:21,570
我不知道  可能...
I don't know. May...

162
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:22,760
可能台词有问题
You know, maybe it's in the words.

163
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,390
你怎么知道
How would you know?

164
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,530
你从没说过那段词
You've never said them.

165
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,500
没有啊  我...  我正说着呢
Uh, no, I think... I think I'm saying 'em.

166
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,660
不对  你是  说了几句
No. I mean, yeah, like, s-some.

167
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:29,080
说了点
Kind of.

168
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,360
可你大多都改了
But you're-you're mostly paraphrasing.

169
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,540
-对不起  -没事没事
- I'm sorry. - Y-Yeah.

170
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:34,200
你看  其实很简单
You see, it's really simple.

171
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:37,440
奥利维亚就是杰西卡  你的妻子
Olivia is Jessica, your wife.

172
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,440
-又来了  -你就是大卫
- Okay. - You are David.

173
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,270
你爱她
You loved her,

174
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,840
可现在她死了
but now she is dead.

175
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:48,960
所以你正为失去她而悲痛不已
So you are grieving the loss of her.

176
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,350
你的世界都崩塌了
There's no longer any such thing as gravity.

177
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,590
你有没有失去过什么人
Have you ever lost anyone?

178
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:57,740
有
Yes.

179
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,330
可我不相信你
Because I don't believe you.

180
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:00,800
知道吗  罗恩  我的工作
Well, you know, Ron, it's not my job

181
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,030
不是要让你来相信我
to make sure you believe me.

182
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,900
不  不对  就是这样
Oh, yes, yes, it is! It is!

183
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,410
这就是你的事
It is exactly your job!

184
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:08,070
做好你该做的事
Do your job.

185
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,300
她在写什么
What is she writing?

186
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,190
你写什么呢
What are you writing?

187
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,290
写她的绝命书
That's her suicide note.

188
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:14,710
好了  好了  你们都够了  好吗
All right, all right, enough, okay?

189
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:16,490
他能做到的
He'll get there.

周二上午十点  大家再来

193
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,700
-多谢你  -只是必要的过程
- Thank you. - It's a process.

194
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,570
先别再想了
Just... let it go for now.

195

00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,490
我去  不是吧
There's no way in hell.

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,110
这工作最好值得我费劲爬上去
This job better be worth it.

204

我知道我之前在我哥哥手下的工作经历
I realize that my previous employment with my brother

215
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:20,140
可能和这份工作不是很相符
might not be directly applicable.

216
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:23,030
可是我这人做事条理分明
However, I am abnormally organized.

217
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:26,790
{\an8}1997年美国电影

226
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:42,870
我知道他们是你们基金的主要捐助者

在你哥哥之前  他是你老板  对吗

他对你称赞有加
He speaks about you in such glowing terms.

234
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:57,010
你为什么要离开他的公司
Why did you quit his firm?

235
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:00,120
因为我爱上了他
Because I fell in love with him,

236
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,180
所以我们不适合一起工作
and it was not a healthy situation.

237
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,360
我喜欢你  凯特
I like you, Kate.

240
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,590
但并不是做助理的工作
Now, it's not assistant work.

241
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,860
既要协调活动  又要拓展业务
It's part event coordinator, part development associate.

242
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,940
荣幸之至
I would be absolutely thrilled.

243
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:17,570
不过你可能还得替我办些私事
But there is some personal stuff you may have to do,

244
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:18,590
有时跑跑腿
an errand here or there,

245
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:20,790
开车接送我女儿
maybe drive my daughter to and from?

246
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:22,260
好啊  没问题

247
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,850
-偶尔的  所以别担心  -当然不会

那么  你接受这份工作吗

249
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:27,920
等等  真的吗
Wait, really?

250
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:29,720
我太激动了
I'm so excited!

251
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,520
我也很激动
Well, I'm so excited!

252
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:33,560
从卫生纸粘住你头的那一刻起
I wanted you from the moment

253
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,500
我就已经决定要你了
the toilet paper was stuck to your head.

254
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,070
说真的  不管你需要什么
Seriously, though, whatever you need,

255
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,340
我都愿意去做
I'm your girl.

256
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:44,040
这是我女儿  杰玛  这位是凯特
This is my daughter. Jemma, this is Kate.

257
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,120
你雇了个胖子啊
So, I see you picked the fat one.

258
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:57,010
{\an8}我们的生活
第一季  第六集

259
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,190
天气衍生品是一种贸易商品
Weather derivatives are tradable commodities

260
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,050
它能够保护企业所有者
that protect business owners

261
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,270
免受天气变化的影响
from future changes in the weather.

262
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,870
就好比你舔一下披萨
It's like licking a piece of pizza

263
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,770
别人就不会吃了
so that nobody will eat it later.

264
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,080
我开始想披萨了
Now I'm thinking about pizza.

265
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,570
-好吧  -不  等等  抱歉  等一下
- Okay. - No, wait, I'm sorry-- no, no, no, wait,

266
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:21,550
我这次是想搞清楚的
I was gonna get it this time.

267
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:24,430
如果连我的老婆孩子都不理解我是做什么的
Look, how am I supposed to inspire an auditorium full of strangers,

268
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:26,480
我又怎么能打动一个礼堂的陌生人呢
and my own wife and kids don't even understand what I do?

269
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,930
-不是这样的  -真的吗
- That's not true. - Really?

270
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:29,330
我是做什么的
What do I do?

271
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,440
你买卖天气
You trade weather.

272
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,360
你根据天气类型交易商品
You trade commodities based on weather patterns.

273
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,560
这又是什么意思呢
And what does that mean?

274
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:40,590
该死  兰德尔  我不知道
Oh, damn, Randall, I don't know.

275
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:42,800
你用闪电球交换雷暴云
You swap lightning bolts for thunder clouds?

276
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:44,930
我知道你每天都是怎么度过的
Look, I know what your day is like.

277
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:46,970
我知道你喜欢其中一个合伙人
I know that you like one of your partners

278
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:48,530
却讨厌另外一个
and you hate the other one.

279
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:51,010
我知道你打算重新设计办公室的家具
I know that you're gonna redesign your office furniture

280
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,800
你还有可能解雇你的助理
and that you might fire your assistant

281
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,010
因为她总是说"好像"  
because she says "like" too much.

282
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:55,100
她说个不停
It's nonstop.

283
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,730
我能和你深入地探讨一下天气类型吗
Can I talk to you in depth about weather patterns?

284
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:59,090
不行  我做不到
No, I cannot.

285
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,730
即便我能  你也不会答应的  所以...
But I don't think you'd want me to if I could, so...

286
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:04,390
你到底怎么了
Hey, what's-what's this really about?

287
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,540
或许我本该成为一位音乐家
Maybe I was meant to be a musician.

288
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,420
不好意思  你说什么
I'm sorry, what now?

289
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,230
或者艺术家  或者作家
Or an artist or a writer.

290
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,620
想想看  贝丝
Just think about it, Beth.

291
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,100
也许我身上是有这种天赋的
There's this whole genetic side of me

292
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,790
只是根本没人发现
that nobody even knew existed.

293
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,570
我是说  威廉是个诗人
I mean, William was a poet,

294
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,420
艺术家  音乐家
an artist, a musician.

295
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:26,020
也许我一直很有艺术天赋
You know, maybe I've had an artistic side in me all along

296
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,560
可没人发掘出来
and nobody knew to empower it.

297
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:29,620
或许我不该做一个
You know, maybe I wasn't meant to be

298
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,380
每天必须西装革履
a straight and narrow math geek

299
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,750
中规中矩跟数字打交道的呆子
destined to wear a shirt and tie every day

300
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,960
就像我父母想象的那样
like my parents thought.

301
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,350
也许我这辈子就该做个音乐家
Maybe I was meant to live a musician's life.

302
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:40,230
到处奔走  在酒吧里演奏
On the road and playing clubs, you know?

303
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:44,020
好吧  在你这个音乐家的梦中
All right, well, in this musical fantasy version of yourself,

304
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,870
-你演奏哪种...  -萨克斯
- what instrument would you... - Sax.

305
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,500
{\an8}1990年美国爵士乐电影

306
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,500
就像《爱情至上》中的韦斯利
Like Wesley in Mo' Better Blues.

307
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,390
一定得是萨克斯
Definitely sax.

308
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:50,140
是啊
Oh, yeah.

309
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,710
真是太性感了
That's sexy, yeah.

310
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:52,780
你在笑话我
You're making fun of me.

311
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,610
-没有  -有  你就是在笑话我
- No. - No, you're making fun of me.

312
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:57,010
不  没有  我没有啦
No, I am not. I'm-I'm not.

313
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:59,100
你亲生父亲刚回到你的生活中
Your biological father just came back into your life,

314
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,650
这激起了你的很多想法
and it's bringing up all kinds of stuff.

315
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:03,130
这  这很正常
It's-it's normal.

316
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:05,260
听着
Look,

317
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:09,440
你不妨试试展示下自己狂野艺术家的一面
why don't you try out this-this crazy artist side

318
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:13,250
在这次发言中一鸣惊人
of yourself and, you know, get this presentation popping.

319
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,990
看看八岁小观众们喜不喜欢  好吗
Let's see how it flies with some eight-year-olds, right?

320
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,900
在你真的改行
Before you, like, shift careers

321
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:21,030
去夜场演奏萨克斯风之前先实践下
and start playing open mic saxophone nights.

322
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,500
-也许我真会去  -那好啊
- You know, maybe I will. - Okay, yeah.

323
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,790
我知道你在笑话我  不过我会试试的
I see you are making fun of me, but I will.

324
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:24,990
没有  好啊
No, yeah.

325
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:26,620
-你能不能不笑了  -我停不下来
- Why don't you stop smiling? - I can't.

326
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,190
-别笑了  -抱歉
- Stop smiling. - I'm sorry.

327
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:31,630
我忍不住  这中年危机早期症状太像你了
This early midlife crisis is so you, I can't stand it.

328
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:34,280
你想再来点笑料吗
You want something to smile about?

329
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,970
-不要了  拜托  -真的  真的吗
- No, please. - Do you, do you really?

330
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,570
你好  麻烦找下麦克尔
Hi, can I speak to Michael please?

331
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:51,880
唐纳  我是凯特

Oh, good. Are you by any chance

334
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:57,490
来参加个慈善会
available on the third for a charity event?

335
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:58,640
我有个问题想问下你
Hey, I have a question for you:

336
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,040
你对无家可归现象怎么看
how do you feel about homelessness?

337
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:01,490
我明白  很糟糕  对吧
I know, it's a bummer, right?

338
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:03,670
我们差不多要接待四百人
So, we're looking to cater about 400 people.

339

您的餐厅势必也想加入到我们的活动

00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,280
我要你载我去艾希莉家
I need you to take me to Ashley's.

345
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,880
让凯特载你去怎么样
Oh, well, what if Kate gave you a ride?

346
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,790
可以吗
Do you mind?

347
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,070
行
No.

348
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:22,510
抱歉
Sorry.

349
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,360
我在车里等你  实习生
I'll be in the car, intern.

350
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:43,950
-要进去了吗  -好
- Should we go in? - Yeah.

351
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,280
这到底是个什么派对
Listen, what kind of party is this anyway?

352
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,830
大家看着都很难过的样子
'Cause everyone seems pretty sad.

353
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:47,800
当然难过了
Of course they're sad.

354
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,380
这是场追悼会
It's a memorial service.

355
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,050
快点  我们进去吧
Come on, in we go,

356
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:52,640
不然好吃的奶酪要没了
before all the good cheese is gone.

357
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,330
{\an8}海恩斯学院

358
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,700
我们来这儿干嘛
What are we doing here?

359
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,410
我们来这
We are here

360
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:04,410
是因为你妻子  还记得她吗
because your wife-- do you remember her?

361
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,660
应该记得
I think so, yeah.

362
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,760
你爱她胜于生命的那个人
The one that you love more than life itself?

363
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,190
-想起来了  -那就好
- Definitely rings a bell. - Got it.

364
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:11,710
她想看看这地方
She wants to take a look at this place.

365
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,250
好吧  我在看呢
Okay, I'm looking.

366
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,300
天啊  这地方比兰德尔 
Geez, this place is whiter

367
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:20,120
之前那满是白人的学校还要"白"啊
than Randall's already pretty white other school.

368
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,110
看看这些孩子
I mean, look at these kids.

369
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:25,730
他们就像小小的纳粹机器人
They look like little nazi robots.

370
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:27,400
那小孩还拎了个公文包
That one's got a briefcase.

371
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:30,990
我说  哪有孩子拎公文包的啊
I... no kid should be carrying a briefcase.

372
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,950
我觉得很可爱啊
I think it's cute.

373
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:33,810
是  你现在是觉得可爱  往后他余生
Yeah, it's cute now; next thing you know, he's gonna be

374
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:36,360
都要被困在办公室的小格子里了
trapped in a cubicle for the rest of his life.

375
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,720
我告诉你吧  先是拎个公文包
I tell you, it starts with a briefcase,

376
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,920
接着再系上个领带  坐上办公桌
then you put on a tie, you sit at a desk.

377
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,940
接下来你猜怎样  你就被束缚在日光灯下了
Next thing you know, you are so conditioned to the florescent lights

378
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:46,600
你走到外面  连太阳都会刺痛你的眼睛
that when you step outside, the sun actually burns your eyes.

379
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:51,930
真的吗
Really?

380
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,070
我说的不是自己
This isn't about me.

381
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:56,350
肯定也不是说兰德尔吧
Well, it certainly isn't about Randall.

382
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:03,920
我  我本来不打算在有初步规划前
Look, I... I wasn't gonna say anything

383
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,850
把事情说出来的  不过...
until I'd had a few details worked out, but...

384
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,870
我打算自己出来混了
I think I'm gonna go out on my own.

385
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,430
自己开公司
Start my own company.

386
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,800
三个小家伙之家  我只是...
Big Three Homes. I just...

387
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,810
现在说可能有点不合时宜
Doesn't feel like a very good time right now.

388
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,800
我觉得挺好的
I think it's great.

389
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,770
你应该去试试
I think you should do it.

390
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,690
没那么简单的  小贝
It's not that easy, Bec.

391
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:32,490
这个地方得花多少钱
I mean... what does this place even cost?

392
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:34,370
我们会想到办法的
We'll figure it out.

393
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:38,530
会有办法的  我们可以让兰德尔换一所学校
We'll figure it out-- we'll send Randall to another school,

394
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:41,250
给他请个家教  尽我们所能
we'll get him a tutor, we'll do whatever we have to do.

395
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,940
好  我只希望你能快乐
All right. I just don't want you to be unhappy.

396
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,420
-我说真的  -明白
- I mean it. - Okay.

397
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:51,600
那就好
All right.

398
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,490
我们会再回来的
We'll come back.

399
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,080
这儿很漂亮
This is nice.

400
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,270
非常漂亮
It's very nice.

401
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,190
杰玛  你妈妈说你会告诉我
Jemma, your mom told me that you would be giving me

402
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,370
艾希莉家的地址
Ashley's address.

403
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,170
杰玛  你能不能回答我的问题
Jemma, will you answer me?

404
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,060
杰玛  我需要地址
Jemma, I'm gonna need the address.

405
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:16,300
-干嘛  你急着回去工作吗  -是的
- Why? 'Cause you need to get back to work? - Yes.

406
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:17,620
要不是看重这份工作
And if I didn't value the work,

407
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,310
我也不会甘愿忍受你这态度了
I wouldn't be tolerating this attitude.

408
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,680
只是澄清下
Just so we're clear.

409
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,320
她跟你说什么了  让你当合伙人吗
What'd she tell you, you'd be an associate?

410
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,820
你真以为我妈妈会因为
And you thought my mom was gonna

411
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,920
一些三流明星接你的电话
give you actual responsibilities,

412
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,650
就给你真正的职位吗
because a few C-list celebrities take your calls?

413
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,260
很显然  她雇你
Clearly she only hired you

414
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,360
只是因为她觉得一个胖女孩会走进我的内心
because she thinks the fat girl can get through to me.

415
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:37,100
我猜她是觉得  越胖越好吧
Guess she figured, bigger the better.

416
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:39,760
其实我觉得你挺可怜的
You know, I actually feel bad for you.

417
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:41,820
搞什么鬼
What the hell?

418
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:44,900
你别可怜我  好吧
Yeah, well, don't feel bad for me, okay?

419
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,390
因为我还有车回家
'Cause I have a ride home.

420
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:47,880
什么意思
I'm sorry?

421
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:49,440
-下车  -什么
- Get out. - What?

422
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,360
给我下车  杰玛  不然我把你扔出去
Get out of the damn car, Jemma, before I toss you out of it!

423
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,650
你知道吗  你可以走路去艾希莉家
And you know what? You can walk to Ashley's.

424
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:00,630
给你分享胖女孩的心得  如果你走得快
And fat girl to fat girl, if you keep up the pace,

425
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:03,110
走路一小时可以燃烧417卡路里
you can burn 417 calories an hour walking.

426
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,770
我太爱美式奶酪了
I love American cheese.

427
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:17,240
英式奶酪吃起来总是很沮丧  太烦了
English cheese is so blue, it's angry.

428
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:20,580
美式奶酪就好像是可以躺上去的床
American cheese is like a-a bed you can just fall into.

429
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:23,520
话说回来  这是谁的告别聚会
So, whose good-bye party is this anyway?

430
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,080
弗兰克·彭德格拉斯
Frank Pendergrass.

431
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:26,570
三天前他在中央公园慢跑时
Tree branch fell on him three days ago

432
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,530
树枝砸在了他身上
when he was jogging through Central Park.

433
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,310
就这么死了
Bang. Dead.

434
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,510
这也太倒霉了
Well, that sucks.

435
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:33,090
你怎么认识他的
You knew him how?

436
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,880
我不认识  讣告上写了追悼会的地址
Oh, I didn't. No, the obituary gave the address of the service,

437
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,280
于是我就...
so, I thought...

438
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:38,400
等一下
Hold on a second.

439
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:39,300
你是什么意思
What are you trying to say?

440
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,450
你好
Hello.

441
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,600
我是弗兰克的妻子  格蕾丝
I'm Frank's wife, Grace.

442
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,580
你好  我叫杰西卡
Hi. Uh, I'm Jessica.

443
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,210
这是我丈夫  大卫
This is my husband, David.

444
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:50,810
你们是我丈夫的学生吗
Were you students of my husband?

445
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,970
我们其实是在他的课上相识的
We actually met in his class.

446
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,630
是吧
Right?

447
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,060
他学生
Students.

448
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:02,430
当时我们坐在第一排
Yeah, we were sitting in the front row,

449
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:04,170
一直眉来眼去的
and we kept looking at each other,

450
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,350
最后弗兰克看不下去了  停下来说道
and then finally Frank stopped the class and said,

451
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:09,150
"你们俩太让我分心了  出去  上个床
"You two are distracting me. Go outside, have sex,

452
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:11,070
准备好学知识了再进来"
and come back when you're ready to learn something."

453
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,410
还真像弗兰克会说的话
Well, that sounds like Frank.

454
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,910
弗兰克
Frank.

455
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:18,110
谢谢你们的到来
Thank you both so much for coming.

456
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:20,450
-感谢你的到来  -节哀顺变
- Thank you for coming. - I'm so sorry for your loss.

谢谢
Thank you.

458
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:24,910
任务完成了
Well done.

459
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:27,580
不不不  等等  你把我
No, no, no, hold on. No, no, no. You brought...

460
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,180
你把我带到一个陌生人的葬礼上来
You brought me to a stranger's funeral?

461
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:32,470
-追悼会  -管它叫什么  为什么
- Memorial service. - Whatever. Why

462
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,670
因为我演不好苦情戏吗
What, because I'm struggling with the grief scene?

463
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:35,790
你说过我会演好的
You said I would get there.

464
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:37,570
是啊  但我可没说凭你自己能演好
Yeah, well, I didn't say you'd get there on your own.

465
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:38,770
这也太疯狂了
This is insane.

466
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:40,880
但是十分感谢你的这一课
But thank you very much for the lesson.

467
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,880
我很感激  现在我要去喝杯酒
I appreciate it. Now I'm gonna go have a drink.

468
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,330

Enjoy your cheese.

冰箱都放不下了
There's no room in here

493
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:01,980
我也不知道把弗兰克的食物放哪儿
and I don't know where to put all of Frank's food.

494
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:10,980
好多腌黄瓜
You have a lot of pickles.

495
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,360
我讨厌腌黄瓜
I hate pickles.

496
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:18,520
但是他超爱的
But he loves them.

497
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:21,480
他在床上吃
Yeah, he eats them in bed.

498
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,110
曾经
"Ate."

499
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:28,260
现在他是过去式了
He is now past tense.

500
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,060
以前可以直呼其名
He used to be "is."

501
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,620
现在都要加个曾经
Now he is "was."

502
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,580
我喜欢腌黄瓜
Hey, I like pickles.

503
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,650
那太好了
Good.

504
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,320
-给你  -好
- Here. - OK.

505
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,510
你喜欢节日领带吗
How do you feel about holiday ties?

506
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,920
还有运动外套
And sport coats.

507
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,760
因为我问过杰里米了
Because I asked Jeremy,

508
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,830
他说不需要任何他爸爸的遗物
but he said he didn't want anything of his dad's.

509
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:00,140
杰里米多大了
How old is Jeremy?

510
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,440
十五岁
Fifteen.

511
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:06,260
这太残忍了
That's tough.

512
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:08,800
十五岁的话太残忍了
15 is tough.

513
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:14,050
我小时候
Uh, my dad and I

514
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:18,040
我和我爸会一起拼模型  
used to build models together, when I was a kid.

515
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:18,930
是吗
Yeah?

516
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:22,640
是的  我们会拼飞机  轮船
Yeah, we'd build, um, planes and boats.

517
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,530
我以前总是挑最难的拼
I used to pick the most complex ones,

518
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:27,040
B-52轰炸机  航空母舰
B-52s, aircraft carriers,

519
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,590
因为做这些花的时间最长
'cause they took the longest, you know?

520
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:30,480
我们家有三个孩子
See, I was one of three kids,

521
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,070
所以真得花心思去争取和爸爸独处的时间
so you really had to strategize to get your alone time with Dad.

522
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:33,790
最后
You know, and eventually,

523
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:34,690
我们建了一整只舰队  
we had a whole fleet of them;

524
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,950
一排一排地在架子上陈列着
We had just rows and rows, shelves of them.

525
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,870
当他去世以后...
You know, and then when he died...

526
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,310
当...
when...

527
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,780
当他去世后  我...
when he... when he died, I, um...

528
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,440
我把这些模型都扔掉了
I-I threw all the models away.

529
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:52,430
我把每一个都扔掉了
I threw every one of them away.

530
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:55,820
我也不知道我为什么要这样做
I don't know why... why I did that, you know?

531
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:57,640
那时你多大
You were how old?

532
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:00,540
那是很久以前了
Uh, it was a long time ago.

533
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:04,720
我还留着...
I have, um...

534
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,850
我还留着这个
I have this.

535
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,880
这个项链  这是他的
This necklace, this is his and, um,

536
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:13,750
我就只留了他这条链子
it's the only thing I have left of him.

537
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:16,190
最开始  我并不想戴
And at first, you know, I didn't want to wear it,

538
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,350
我不会戴  甚至都不想看  但现在...
I wouldn't wear it, I wouldn't even look at it, but now it's...

539
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:24,260
我只有这了  我不能取下来  所以...
It's all I have and I... I can't take it off now, so...

540
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:26,730
没事的
It's okay.

541
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,750
天哪  这实在太蠢了  
Oh, my God, this is so dumb.

542
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:44,360
我在做什么  我该来安慰你才是
What am I doing? I'm supposed to be comforting you,

543
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:46,770
而不是把鼻涕流你身上到处都是
not snotting all over you.

544
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,300
你叫什么来着
Who are you again?

545
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:02,340
兰德尔  你爸爸来了
Randall, your daddy's here.

546
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,460
我们马上完了
We're almost done.

547
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:04,910
三局两胜
Best two out of three.

548
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,630
好
Okay.

549
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,280
谢谢你让他来你家玩
Hey, thanks for -- thanks for having him.

550
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,120
他想来  我随时欢迎
Oh, I will take him as much as he'll have it.

551
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,480
让我家孩子也看看什么叫礼貌
Show my own boys what manners look like.

552
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:23,860
丽贝卡告诉你  他在学校的事了吗
Hey, did Rebecca tell you about his school?

553
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,630
没有  怎么了
No. What happened?

554
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:29,340
他好像是考试得了很高的分
I guess he scored off the charts on some tests,

555
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:32,380
现在校方想把他送走
and now they want to uproot him during the school year,

556
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:34,100
送去私立学院什么的
send him to some private academy.

557
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,770
把他和其他两个孩子分开
You know, take him away from the other two.

558
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:37,590
为什么  那是个寄宿学校吗
Why? Is it, is it a boarding school?

559
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,230
不是
No.

560
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:39,510
就是
No, it's, uh--

561
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:43,030
就是穿制服什么的
it's uniforms and,

562
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:45,150
身边全都是白人小孩
a lot of little white kids

563
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,720
搞得那里像是在德国纳粹一样
marching around like it's Nazi Germany.

564
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,110
我明白了
Oh, I see.

565
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:52,160
所以你才向我咨询
That's why you're running this by me.

566
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:53,920
什么
What?

567
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,110
你想找一个黑人批准你在育儿方面
You're looking for me to give you the black person seal of approval

568
00:24:57,110 --> 00:25:00,140
做一个糟糕的决定
for any messed-up parenting decision you make.

569
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,470
怎么就糟糕了  我只是...
How is it messed up? I just--

570
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:05,650
不想让我儿子觉得自己更特殊而已
I don't want my son to feel more different.

571
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:08,890
所以就因为他是黑人  你就想阻碍他的发展
Okay, so you just want to hold him back because he's black?

572
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,970
不  当然不是了
No. Absolutely not. I...

573
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:13,050
杰克
Jack,

574
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,320
兰德尔是个特别的孩子
Randall is special.

575
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:20,480
如果你让他放弃如此好的一个机会
So, if you're looking for somebody to make you feel better

576
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,850
还期待别人会来安慰你
about denying him a special opportunity,

577
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:27,860
你还是另找一位黑人吧
you may just have to find yourself another black person.

578
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,940
再见了  伙计们
See you, guys.

579
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:32,590
准备好啦
Ready, Freddy.

580
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:34,250
再见  伊薇特夫人
Bye, Ms. Yvette.

581
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:35,820
-赢了吗  -当然
- Did you win? - Yep.

582
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:59,790
当我把她的孩子送到她怀里时
And I'll never forget the look on her face

583
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:02,340
她的表情我永生难忘
when I placed her child back into her arms.

584
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,210
永生难忘
Never.

585
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,620
这就是我的工作
So, yeah, that's what I do.

586
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:05,300
日复一日地
Day in and day out,

587
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:09,860
将像你们这样的孩子从火里救出来
I save children, just like you guys, from fires.

588
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:11,820
谢谢
Thank you.

589
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:17,550
大家为肯德尔的妈妈曼迪鼓掌
Let's give it up for Kendal's mom, Mandy! Yeah.

590
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:23,600
下一位是苔丝的爸爸  兰德尔
All right, okay, uh, up next is Tess's dad, Randall,

591
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:25,100
他是位气象员
who is a weatherman.

592
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,100
抱歉抱歉
Oh, sorry, sorry.

593
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,300
说错了
Uh, strike that.

594
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:32,460
他是位天气交易员
He's a weather trader.

595
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:37,200
我不知道这是干什么的  听他解释吧
I don't know what that is, but I think he's gonna tell us.

596
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,400
欢迎兰德尔
Here's Randall.

597
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,700
你们好
Hey, y'all.

598

我是天气交易员
I'm a weather trader,

599
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:55,450
我知道这个很难解释
which I know can be a little bit hard to explain,

600
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,050
于是
and so, um,

601
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,550
我给你们写了首歌
I wrote you guys a song about it.

602
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,650
爸爸不是不会弹钢琴吗
I thought Daddy couldn't play the piano?

603
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:12,070
爸爸的确不会啊
Daddy cannot.

604
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,340
*如果你*
*If you*

605
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:18,100
等等  等一下  抱歉
Wait, mm, hold on one second. Sorry about that.

606
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,410
天呐
Oh, sweet Jesus.

607
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:20,670
若你...
If you...

608
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:22,930
请稍等
Mm. One second, please.

609

622
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:17,740

623
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:22,520
*保护自己的庄稼吧*
*To protect your crops.*

624
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,220
你在这里啊
Ah, there you are.

625
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,640
我刚和格蕾丝在一起
I was with Grace.

626
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:27,680
谁
Who?

627
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:30,460
格蕾丝  弗兰克的妻子  
Grace. Frank's wife.

628
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,390
为什么
Why?

629
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:35,060
因为她很悲伤  她丈夫过世了
Because she's sad. Her husband died.

630
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,250
你为什么跟我凶
Why are you mad at me?

631
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:40,770
因为我们不该来的
Because we shouldn't be here.

632
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:42,850
这不是一场戏
This is not a play.

633
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:44,380
她是一个真实的人
You know, she's a real person.

634
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:46,190
我也是一个真实的人
I'm a real person.

635
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:49,160
我能看出来  终于看出来了
Yeah, I can see that-- maybe for the first time.

636
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,040
你经历过什么
What happened to you?

637
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,830
我父亲过世了
What happened is my dad died.

638
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:54,820
就是这样
That's what.

639
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,070
而我因此痛恨他
And I hated him for it.

640
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,900
我曾一个月无法进食
And I couldn't eat for a month,

641
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,660
我曾每日醒来以泪洗面
and I used to wake myself up crying,

642
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,670
这样就可以再次在泪水中入眠
so I could cry myself back to sleep again.

643
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:05,750
这就是我的经历
That's what happened.

644
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,830
你为什么将这些情感撇开
Why do you push all of that away?

645
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:14,720
这些不是你害怕的妖怪
You can't just kill the feelings

646
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:17,040
你无法扼杀自己的情绪
like they're some creature that you're afraid of.

647
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:20,090
这种痛楚是你的一部分
That pain is a part of you.

648
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:22,200
我现在能看出来
I can see it now.

649
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,100
也能感觉到
I can feel it.

650
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:34,430
抱歉  吃过腌菜
Sorry, pickle mouth.

651
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:35,790
我不介意
I don't care.

652
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:46,480
杰玛还好吗
Is Jemma OK?

653
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:48,130
什么  她很好
What? She's fine.

654
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:50,380
她说今天和你相处得很愉快
She said she had a really nice day with you.

655
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,110
但我根本不信
Which I didn't believe for a second,

656
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,790
因为你没有回来  所以我追问了她
because you didn't come back, so I pressed.

657
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,810
丢下她  我很抱歉
I am really sorry that I left her.

658
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:02,730
如果你想以遗弃儿童罪起诉
I can understand if you want to press charges

659
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:04,290
我可以理解
for child abandonment.

660
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,410
天呐  快别这么说
God, don't even worry about it.

661
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:08,220
我自己还曾把她丢在三大百货
I've left her at Three Malls myself,

662
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,880
而且不止一次在高速路上
and I've wanted to shove her out of the car

663
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,670
想把她从车里丢出去
on the freeway at least once.

664
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,720
我都不知道拿她怎么办了
I don't know what to do with her anymore.

665
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,210
我走不进她的内心
I can't reach her.

666
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:18,850
昨天之前
Before yesterday,

667
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:22,260
她在两周里只和我说过七个字
she's spoken seven words to me in two weeks.

668
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,380
你也听到了
And you heard them:

669
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:25,350
"你雇了个胖子啊"
"I see you hired the fat one."

670
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,130
这是你雇我的原因吗
Is that why you hired me?

671
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:30,870
不  天呐  当然不是
No! God, no.

672
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,300
不全是这样
Not entirely.

673
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,270
我猜就是
Yeah, I thought so.

674
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:35,760
我也知道这样不好
I am not proud of it.

675
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:39,010
我很抱歉  但那真不是唯一的原因
I am sorry and it's really not the only reason.

676
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:42,110
见你本人之前  我就很喜欢你的简历
I-I liked your resume before I met you.

677
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:44,690
但  确实
But, yeah.

678
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,830
我觉得你可能会...
I thought that maybe you'd be able to...

679
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,610
理解她
understand her.

680
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,470
理解她的问题
Her issues.

681
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,020
天呐  我这样说出来
Oh, my God, it sounds horrible

682
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:56,200
太伤人了
when I say it out loud.

683
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,440
天呐  拜托别辞职
God, please don't quit.

684
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:05,180
别再让我处理私人事务了
No more personal stuff.

685
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:08,730
你看到我工作  了解我的能力了
You saw my work; you know I can do it.

686
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,680
别再让我开车带杰玛了
No more driving Jemma around.

687
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,550
你可以雇一个助手代劳的
You can afford an assistant for that.

688
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:14,790
-成交  -我要加入蝴蝶舞会
- Done. - And I want to chair the Butterfly Ball.

689
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,210
-可以  -我还要一间办公室
- It's yours. - And I want an office.

690
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:17,810
-没问题  -我还想要一个实习生
- Okay. - And I want an intern.

691
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:19,500
好吧  太过了
Okay, too far.

692
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,400
明天九点见
I'll see you at 9:00 tomorrow.

693
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:27,660
谢谢
Thank you.

694
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:31,610
杰玛还在这里吗
Hey, is Jemma still here?

695
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:32,650
在外面
She's outside.

696
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:34,690
好的
Okay.

697
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,890
喂喂  皮尔森公司
Hello? Hello? Pearson Corporation.

698
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:41,740
想谈一单大生意吗
Would you like to discuss the big deal?

699
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:45,560
我太忙了  你回头打给我吧
Well, I'm too busy. You'll have to call back.

700
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,500
喜欢过来和爸爸一起工作  是不是
You love coming to work with Dad, huh?

701
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:53,160
我想让你来帮我一些忙
I wanted you here because I need your help with something.

702
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:55,980
过来
Come here.

703
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:58,830
这是什么
What's that?

704
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:02,020
这是公司负责在建的房子
That is a house the company's working on.

705
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:04,060
-真酷  -是啊
- Cool. - Yeah.

706
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,460
你看
You see, uh...

707
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:12,170
你看  我不知道  建这面墙需要多少
You see, I don't know how many feet of two-by-four

708
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:13,810
宽四寸厚二尺的板材
I'm gonna need for this wall right here.

709
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:16,280
你知道三英尺是多少...
You see how each... how each inch is...

710
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,180
多少英寸吗
is three feet?

711
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,490
22.5英尺
22h feet.

712
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,160
真了不起  小家伙
That's pretty cool, buddy.

713
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:24,910
没想到你数学这么好
Didn't know you were so good with numbers.

714
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,740
等等  过来
Wait, wait, wait. Come here.

715
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:31,790
那这面墙呢
What about this wall right here?

716
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:33,770
建这面墙需要多少
How many... how many do I need for that?

717
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:36,110
这个我不会算
I don't know that one.

718
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:40,380
一秒钟前你还会算  现在不会了吗
You knew how do it a second ago, now you don't?

719
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,650
我不知道  爸爸
I don't know it, Dad.

720
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:44,020
你肯定会算
I think you do.

721
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:44,930
我不会
I don't.

722
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:48,530
兰德尔  别闹了
Randall, that's enough.

723
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:50,660
-过来  -我不想算
- Come here. - I don't want to.

724
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:54,110
看  就是这面墙
Look. This wall, right here.

725
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,200
我需要多少板材
How much do I need?

726
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,660
-我不知道  不知道  -把答案说出来
- I don't know. I don't know. - Tell me the answer.

727
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:00,340
多少英尺  快告诉我
How many feet? Tell me right now.

728
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:01,140
我不知道
I don't know.

729
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,920
见鬼  兰德尔  快说答案
Damn, it, Randall, tell me the answer!

730
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:06,750
34英尺
34.

731
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:07,960
说什么
What's that?

732
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:09,240
34英尺
34.

733
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:15,190
很正确
That's right.

734
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:19,390
你为什么要假装不会算这些题呢
Why are you pretending not to know this stuff, huh?

735
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,410
故意在数学中考个B
Getting B's in math?

736
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,260
不让别人知道你很聪明
Not letting people see how smart you are?

737
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,940
我不想和他们不一样
I don't want to be different from them.

738
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,870
和谁不一样  学校里那些孩子吗
Different from who? Who, the kids at school?

739
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:32,810
如果得了A  我就有冰激凌吃
If... if I get an A, I'll get ice cream,

740
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:34,170
而凯特和凯文没有
and Kate and Kevin won't.

741
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,870
他们会恨我的
And then they'll hate me.

742
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:46,500
我能跟你说实话吗
Can I be honest with you?

743
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:48,050
男人间的对话
Man to man?

744
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,640
你妈妈和我总是尽力
You know, your mom and me, we always try

745
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,040
对你们几个一视同仁
to treat you kids the same.

746
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,330
一向如此
Always have.

747
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:57,330
但并不总是有效  
Hasn't always worked, because, well,

748
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,480
因为你们本来就不一样
you're not all the same.

749
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:04,670
你是我们领养的  我们没好好谈过这事
You're adopted, and we don't talk about that enough.

750
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:07,250
因为对我来说  你完全就是我儿子
'Cause to me, you are every part my son.

751
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:14,420
也许...我不想让你觉得自己太突出
Maybe I.. I don't want you to feel like you stand out.

752
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,280
但是你得知道一件事
But I need you to know something.

753
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:22,770
我希望你出类拔萃
I want you to stand out.

754
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:26,490
我希望你们每一个都能
I want all of you to be as different

755
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,820
与众不同
as you can possibly be.

756
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:31,630
做最好的自己
In all the best ways.

757
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:36,320
我倾尽全力爱你  孩子
I love you as much as a human heart can, kiddo.

758
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:40,240
你是个出众的年轻人
You are an exceptional young man.

759
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,140
别让你爸卑微的想法
So don't let your dad's poor choice

760
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:48,680
阻碍你展现自我
make you feel afraid to be different.

761
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:51,100
好吗
Okay?

762
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:54,390
好
Okay.

763
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:16,710
把手指放上去弹弹  声音更美妙
It sounds better when you put your fingers on it.

764
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:21,070
在电影里
You know how, in the movies,

765
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:22,660
主角不擅长一件事
when somebody's bad at something,

766
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:23,760
但又不想这样
but they don't want to be,

767
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,470
于是就下定决心练习
and so they set their mind to it.

768
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,070
然后通过蒙太奇的剪辑手法
And then we see this montage

769
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:31,440
无数遍的练习镜头呈现在观众眼前
of them practicing and practicing.

770
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,970
而到了最后的关键时刻  就会大放异彩
And then comes the big moment, and they're amazing,

771
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:36,510
大家欢呼喝彩
and everybody cheers.

772
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:39,140
我看过这类电影
I've seen a few movies like that, yeah.

773
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:42,020
我可能跳过了"蒙太奇"部分
I think I skipped the montage.

774
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,070
你第一次告诉我你的工作时
When you first told me what you did for a living,

775
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,360
天  我一个字也听不懂
man, I didn't understand a word.

776
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,660
对天发誓
Hand to God, I mean,

777
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,740
你还不如说些德语什么的
you might as well have been speaking German.

778
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:56,610
但当时我看着你的表情
But I was watching your face.

779
00:35:57,630 --> 00:36:00,790
我没吸毒的时候  我曾与几位
In my better days, I have met and played with

780
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:03,000
世界顶级音乐家一起演奏过
some of the greatest musicians in the world.

781
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:05,630
当他们谈起音乐
And when they talked about music,

782
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:08,290
他们的表情看起来
their face looked like your face

783
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:11,140
和你谈起工作时的表情一模一样
when you told me about whatever the hell it is you do.

784
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:16,320
但是如果有帮助  我可以教你弹一两段琴
But if it'll help, I can show you a thing or two on the piano.

785
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:17,690
那就太棒了
That would be great.

786
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,260
-今晚就算了  -对啊
- Oh, not tonight, just... - Oh, right.

787
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,930
-现在太晚了  -是啊  算了
- It's late is the thing. - Yeah. No.

788
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,650
我明白
I got ya.

789
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:26,990
晚安
Good night.

790
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,000
晚安
Night.

791
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,170
你不用和我告别
You don't have to say bye to me.

792
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:40,370
我没辞职
I didn't quit.

793
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:48,520
我明白你的感受
I know what you're going through.

794
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,500
别想着和我促膝谈心了
Stop trying to have a moment with me.

795
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:00,740
我妈以前很苗条  也很漂亮
So, my mom was skinny and gorgeous.

796
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,750
现在也很漂亮
Well, is gorgeous.

797
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:05,530
大家还是喜欢搭讪她
She still gets hit on by everyone.

798
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:07,950
有一次她得了流感  还被人问起
She once was asked if she was a model

799
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,260
是不是模特儿
when she had the flu.

800
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:12,360
在这样的妈妈身边长大非常艰难
Pretty hard growing up with a mom like that.

801
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,060
我一直不断拿自己和她作比较
I spent all my time comparing myself to her,

802
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,510
然后把气撒在她身上
and then I took it out on her.

803
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:20,720
现在我们几乎不说话了  很糟糕
And now we barely talk, and it sucks.

804
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:26,090
你妈不完美
Hey, your mom's not perfect.

805
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:29,250
她有她的问题  你有你的问题  但是
She has her stuff, and you have yours, but...

806
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:31,520
你别再跟她对着干了
you got to cut her a break.

807
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:35,090
不然你会后悔的
Or you're gonna regret it.

808
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,000
我保证
I promise.

809
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,300
凯特  能配合一下吗
Kate, will you please help me out?

810
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,830
不  我讨厌这件裙子
No, I hate this dress!

811
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:45,140
我知道  可是我不管你讨不讨厌
I know. I don't care that you hate it, though.

812
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,320
就这一件合身的干净衣服
It's what's clean and what fits,

813
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,460
-你穿定这件了  -我恨你
- and it's what you're wearing. - I hate you!

814
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:52,150
快穿上  我们要迟到了
Put it on, please; we're running late.

815
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:53,280
杰克
Hey, Jack?

816
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:55,240
-兰德尔  你们准备好了吗  -好了
- Randall? You guys are ready? - Yeah.

817
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,170
-五分钟后得出发了  -我知道  有我呢
- We have to leave in five minutes. - I know. I got him.

818
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:58,710
你确定吗
You sure about this?

819
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:00,070
对  我确定
Yeah, I'm sure.

820
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:02,740
听你妈妈的话
Hey, listen to your mother.

821
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,090
你看上去棒极了
See, you look great.

822
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:06,880
拿好你的午饭  小姑娘
Come get your lunch, young lady.

823
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:08,240
谢谢
Thank you.

824
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,170
-看清没有  -嗯
- See it? - Yeah.

825
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:13,340
需要点时间练习
Yeah. Takes a little time,

826
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:15,970
不过你会掌握窍门的
but you'll get the hang of it.

827
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:17,040
看着我
Here, look at me.

828
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,870
真精神
Looking sharp.

829
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:20,500
准备好上学第一天了吗
You ready for your first day?

830
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:22,590
凯特和凯文会跟我们一起走吗
Are Kate and Kevin gonna ride with us?

831
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,000
我们先把他们送到学校
We're gonna drop them off,

832
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,550
然后再把你送到学校
then we're gonna drop you off,

833
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:27,570
放学后  我们再一起回家
and then we'll all be back together

834
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:30,270
-好吗  -好
- after school, okay? - Okay.

835
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,730
等等  过来
Hey, wait. Come here.

836
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,430
往下系点
We'll tuck this low.

837
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:37,600
这样好看又舒服
Nice and comfortable.

838
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:40,560
去跟你妈说再见
Say bye to your mom.

839
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:50,210
新鲜出炉的煎饼来了
Hot, plump ones coming through.

840
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:55,160
妈  今天放学后我要去练足球
Mom, I have a soccer practice after school today.

841
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,460
我记得
Yeah, I remember.

842
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:57,360
过来
Come on.

843
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,580
我有话要说
I have something to say.

844
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:10,200
我父亲每天都会系领带
Uh... my dad put on a tie every day

845
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,360
因为他必须这样做
because he had to.

846
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:14,680
我每天系领带  是因为我想这样
I put one on every day because I want to.

847
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:17,890
这点很重要
It's important you know that.

848
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:21,710
也许我不用每天靠出入火场来维持生计
Maybe I don't run into burning buildings for a living,

849
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:25,380
但对我来说  我的工作同样惊险刺激
but to me, my work is challenging and exciting.

850
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,670
也许别人很难理解
I will not apologize for the fact

851
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:29,290
但我不会因此道歉
that it's hard to explain to people.

852
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:31,260
好的  老爸
Okay, Daddy.

853
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,230
还有  威廉
Uh, also, William,

854
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:37,860
谢谢你愿意教我弹钢琴
thank you for offering to teach me piano,

855
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:39,690
但我觉得
but I don't think at this point

856
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:41,410
鉴于我们现在的关系
in our relationship it would be healthy

857
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:43,450
还是先别这么做了
to introduce that dynamic.

858
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:46,090
所以
And so,

859
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,910
下周二开始  我要去上
starting next Tuesday, I'm gonna be taking piano lessons

860
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:50,820
帕金斯女士的钢琴课
from Mrs. Perkins down the road.

861
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:55,290
春天会有一场演奏会
There's gonna be a recital in the spring,

862
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:58,660
我希望你们都能来支持我
and I hope that you will all come and support me in this.

863
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,070
刚才是怎么回事
What was that?

864
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:09,810
那是中年危机  亲爱的
That was a midlife crisis, baby.

865
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,900
这还不算什么  接着吃华夫饼吧
But just a little one, so go on, eat your waffle.

866
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:16,310
"还不算什么"  说得真好
"Just a little one." That's good.

867
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:18,260
他竟然要学钢琴
He-He's gonna take piano?

868
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:21,300
给你买了杯咖啡
Brought you a cappuccino.

869
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,950
牛奶换成豆奶  对吗
Soy, yeah?

870
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,430
你太贴心了
You're too kind.

871
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:27,230
我还想说...
Also wanted to say that, uh...

872
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,550
我想说  我原谅你了
You know, I wanted to say that I forgive you.

873
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:31,860
那节"课"的事...
For the lesson. Um...

874
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,630
我能说什么呢  奏效了
What can I say? It worked.

875
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:36,670
我觉得也是
Mm, I'd say it did.

876
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:40,180
不过课可不止那一节
But, um, that's not the only lesson.

877
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:41,610
不是吗  好吧
No? Okay.

878
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,520
我们之间发生的事...
What happened between you and me...

879
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:48,970
永远不会再发生了
is never gonna happen again.

880
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:52,790
我以为...
Oh. I-I thought...

881
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:56,450
我知道  但我们仅仅只是这种关系
I know you did, but this is who we are and all we are.

882
00:40:56,730 --> 00:41:00,260
你是我丈夫  我是你的亡妻
You're my husband, and I'm your dead wife.

883
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:04,770
你永远不会再和她上床了
And you will never sleep with her again.

884
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:06,730
这让你作何感想
Now, how does that make you feel?

885
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:11,220
悲伤
Sad.

886
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:12,520
好极了
Great.

887
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,820
用上这种情绪
Use that.

888
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:36,330
我加入
I'm in.

889
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:48,730
{\an8}三个小家伙之家

890
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,960
那隐形传输是怎么回事
So what was that about teleportation?

891
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,500
隐形传输和冷空气
Yeah, the teleportation and the freeze breath

892
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,550
或是热空气
or, like, hot breath.

893
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,510
玩得开心
Hey, have fun.

894
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:03,650
再见  爸爸
Bye, Dad.

895
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:05,270
爱你
Love you.
